	This section describes the basic MUDding commands that will let new players
	navigate and observe their new world.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[11.1]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Your character</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	When you are logged into the MUD, you are controlling a virtual character.
	When you created your character, you chose her basic qualities and attributes,
	such as her race, class (profession) and attributes.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can view your character's attributes, statistics and condition by
	entering the command <font color="#009933"><strong>SCORE</strong></font>. As your character becomes more powerful, more
	information is revealed in your score sheet. Your class, race and combat
	kills/deaths statistics are shown in the first section, along with your age and
	the status of some options [see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#13">FAQ 3.13</a> for help
	with options].
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	In the next section of the score sheet, there are three columns of stats,
	although only two will be visible to most new characters. The first column lists
	your character's attributes: strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity and
	constitution. Two values are displayed for each, the first is your actual score,
	the second, in parentheses, is your natural score. The higher your current score
	for attribute, the more developed that attribute is (higher is better). The
	second column shows your character's condition. 'Hits' (hit points) are a
	measure of how much physical injury your character can sustain; when your hits
	reach zero you become stunned, and when they reach -10 you will die. 'Mana' is
	the amount of magical energy your character currently has for spellcasting;
	casting spells drains your mana. 'Move' (or movement points) is a measure of how
	far you are capable of travelling throughout the MUD; when your movement points
	reach zero, you will be exhausted, unable to move any further, and must rest
	(see below). See
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#19">FAQ 3.19</a> for an explanation of 'wimpy' and 'aggro dam'.
	The third column will
	eventually display your 'hitroll' (to-hit attacking bonus), 'damroll' (damage
	bonus), and 'armour class' (how physically protected you are from attack). If
	your character is a ShapeShifter, additional information will also be visible.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The third section of the score sheet displays: your current practice points
	[see <a href="dd-faq-4.html">Section 4</a> of
	this FAQ]; your quest points [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html#1">FAQ 5.1</a>]; your level,
	how many experience points you have, and how many more you need to gain a level
	(see below); any coin you are carrying [see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#35">FAQ 3.35</a>]; how many
	items and how much weight you are carrying; your saving throw versus magical
	attacks (your resistance to magic); your armour class; your fame [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html#8">FAQ 5.8</a>]; and your
	alignment (a measure of how good or evil your character is).
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Sometimes your character can become affected by spells, poisons, curses, and
	so on: enter the command <font color="#009933"><strong>AFFECT</strong></font> to list any effects your character has
	(more information about each effect is shown to higher level characters).
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Your character may also have innate abilities or spells depending on her
	race, and will eventually learn more as she becomes more powerful. Enter
	<font color="#009933"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></font> to view your current skills/spells [see
	<a href="dd-faq-4.html">Section 4</a> for more
	information on skills and training].
</font></p>
<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[11.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Observing and moving about the world</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The MUD world is organised into distinct rooms which have exits to other
	rooms. The term 'room' is often applied to any location in the MUD where your
	character can enter, and it needn't be a room in the common sense of the word
	(space within a building with walls, floor and ceiling)... the 'room' that you
	are in might be the top of a large mountain, a street in a city, or the inky
	blackness of space.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Type <font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK</strong></font> to view the room that you are currently in. You will see a
	description of your location, and any items or objects visible to you. Type
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK [thing]</strong></font>" to look at the contents of a room, e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK
	SIGN</strong></font>", "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK CAT</strong></font>" [see <a href="dd-faq-3.html#38">FAQ 3.38</a> and
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#39">FAQ 3.39</a> for related
	information]. To look inside a container, enter "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK IN [container]</strong></font>",
	e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK IN BOX</strong></font>", "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK IN CORPSE</strong></font>".
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Movement within the world occurs in the cardinal directions: north, south,
	east, west, up and down. To move, you simply enter the direction you wish to
	leave; you only have to enter the first letter of the direction (e.g.
	<font color="#009933"><strong>N</strong></font>, <font color="#009933"><strong>U</strong></font>).
	You can look in a particular direction to gather
	further information, e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK NORTH</strong></font>"; looking before leaping is a good
	habit to get into. The command <font color="#009933"><strong>SCAN</strong></font> will summarise what you can see in
	every direction.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The command <font color="#009933"><strong>EXITS</strong></font> will list what exits are visible to you. Exits are
	often doors, and you may need to open or unlock them: use "<font color="#009933"><strong>OPEN [direction or
	door keyword]</strong></font>" and "<font color="#009933"><strong>UNLOCK [direction or door keyword]</strong></font>", e.g.
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>OPEN NORTH</strong></font>", "<font color="#009933"><strong>UNLOCK GATE</strong></font>".
	Use <font color="#009933"><strong>CLOSE</strong></font> and <font color="#009933"><strong>LOCK</strong></font> in
	the same manner. You can also <font color="#009933"><strong>OPEN</strong></font>, <font color="#009933"><strong>CLOSE</strong></font>, <font color="#009933"><strong>LOCK</strong></font> and
	<font color="#009933"><strong>UNLOCK</strong></font> containers, e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>OPEN CHEST</strong></font>". You can use the command
	<font color="#009933"><strong>ENTER</strong></font> to gain access to some special exits, e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>ENTER GRATE</strong></font>"
	or "<font color="#009933"><strong>ENTER PORTAL</strong></font>".
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Other characters may be on the MUD with you: see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#14">FAQ 3.14</a> to learn how
	to find out who's logged on and how to talk to them.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You are also able to invoke your Deity and ask for divine transportation to
	the safety of town: enter the command <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font>. New characters will recall
	to the Temple of Midgaard; Midgaard is the city where new characters enter the
	game, and spend much of their time. You can gain the ability to recall to other
	places by questing [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html#6">FAQ 5.6</a>]. When players
	say 'at recall', they refer to the room that you appear in after succesfully
	recalling. See
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#4">FAQ 3.4</a> for more information about Midgaard.
	Sometimes, you may not be able to recall successfully: see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#28">FAQ 3.28</a>.

<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	When you are exhausted, or low on hit points, mana or moves, you can
	<font color="#009933"><strong>REST</strong></font> or <font color="#009933"><strong>SLEEP</strong></font> to recover. If you are resting, you remain aware of
	your surroundings but heal at a slower rate than you would if you were sleeping.
	Enter <font color="#009933"><strong>WAKE</strong></font> or <font color="#009933"><strong>STAND</strong></font> to get up and ready for action. See
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#5">FAQ 3.5</a> for more
	information on healing.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You will need to <font color="#009933"><strong>EAT</strong></font> and <font color="#009933"><strong>DRINK</strong></font> to prevent hunger and thirst.
	Enter <font color="#009933"><strong>DRINK</strong></font> to drink from a well or fountain in your current location, or
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>DRINK [container]</strong></font>" to drink from a water container in your inventory,
	e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>DRINK BOTTLE</strong></font>". Type "<font color="#009933"><strong>EAT [food]</strong></font>"
	to eat something in your inventory. See
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#3">FAQ 3.3</a> for help with getting food and drink.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="4"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[11.4]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Manipulating objects and using equipment</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Acquiring good equipment is essential for successful play. Your character is
	able to carry objects in her backpack and wear equipment. Enter <font color="#009933"><strong>INVENTORY</strong></font>
	to list the contents of your inventory, and <font color="#009933"><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong></font> to list what items
	are currently being worn. Enter "<font color="#009933"><strong>WEAR [object]</strong></font>" to equip an item; enter
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>REMOVE [object]</strong></font>" to unequip an item.
	You may "<font color="#009933"><strong>WEAR ALL</strong></font>" and
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>REMOVE ALL</strong></font>".
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Use "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET [object]</strong></font>" and "<font color="#009933"><strong>DROP [object]</strong></font>"
	to pick up and discard
	objects. If you wish to get an object from a container, use "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET [object]
	[container]</strong></font>", e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET GOLDFISH BOWL</strong></font>",
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>GET ALL CORPSE</strong></font>". Use
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>PUT [object] [container]</strong></font>" to put items from your inventory into a
	container. See
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#38">FAQ 3.38</a> if you seem to have trouble indicating which item you really want.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Items in your inventory do not affect your character's statistics. Some types
	of objects affect your character when they are equipped and require no special
	activation, e.g. weapons, armour and light sources. Other items produce effects
	when they are used in a specific way:

	See

<hr><a name="5"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[11.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Experience, combat and magic</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Your 'experience' is a measure of how successfully you have dispatched the
	various monsters and helpless citizens in the MUD via combat. Your power as an
	adventurer is expressed as your 'level'; when you gain a certain amount of
	experience you increase in level, until you reach level 100 and become a Hero.
	Type <font color="#009933"><strong>SCORE</strong></font> to find out what level you are and how much experience you
	have. When you gain a level, you gain hit points, mana, movement points, improve
	in combat, and gain practice points that can be spent on training new skills
	[see <a href="dd-faq-4.html">Section 4</a> of
	this FAQ for information about training].
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You gain experience by killing the creatures (known as 'mobiles' or 'mobs')
	that mill about the MUD world. You can determine whether it's safe to kill a mob
	by using <font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK</strong></font> and <font color="#009933"><strong>CONSIDER</strong></font> [see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#27">FAQ 3.27</a>]. To attack
	a mob, enter "<font color="#009933"><strong>KILL [mob keyword]</strong></font>" or <font color="#009933"><strong>CAST</strong></font> an offensive spell at
	it. The basic action during a fight takes place automatically, and you have the
	opportunity to apply any skills or spells you have mastered while you slog it
	out. If you are worried about how the fight is turning out for you, you can
	attempt to run away by typing <font color="#009933"><strong>FLEE</strong></font> or <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font>. Fleeing or recalling
	is not always successful, and you will lose experience whether you succeed or
	fail.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	When you kill a mob, it usually produces a corpse. You can "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK IN
	CORPSE</strong></font>" to see what equipment the mob was carrying, and take any items by
	entering "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET [item] CORPSE</strong></font>" or "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET ALL CORPSE</strong></font>".
	Mob corpses will
	disappear after a short time, so be quick; you can also "<font color="#009933"><strong>SACRIFICE
	[corpse]</strong></font>" for a copper coin.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Any spells that you can cast are listed on your <font color="#009933"><strong>PRACTICE</strong></font> table. To
	cast a spell, type "<font color="#009933"><strong>CAST [spell]</strong></font>"; if you need to indicate a specific
	target, type "<font color="#009933"><strong>CAST [spell] [object or mob keyword]</strong></font>". Casting spells uses
	up mana, and if you don't have enough mana for a spell you will fail the cast.
	Type <font color="#009933"><strong>SPELLS</strong></font> for a list of spells you have and how much mana they
	require for casting. Mana replenishes over time. You may be able to learn the
	skill 'meditate', which will improve the rate of replenishment.

<p><font color="#000000">
	You can save your character at anytime by typing <font color="#009933"><strong>SAVE</strong></font>. You can leave
	the MUD by typing <font color="#009933"><strong>QUIT</strong></font>. When you quit, your character is automatically
	saved. You must be at least level 2 in order to save.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="7"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[11.7]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Some notes on command syntax</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	MUD commands are issued in pseudo-english, but are very strict in terms of
	how they expect keywords to be supplied to them. Correct sounding english will
	often not be interpreted as you'd imagine, and may produce bizarre or mysterious
	error messages. In most cases, small words like 'the', 'on',
	'from', 'second',
	'my' should not be used. E.g. enter "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET PIE BAG</strong></font>",
	not "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET THE PIE FROM MY BAG</strong></font>"
	(you are trying to get a 'the' from the 'pie').
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Consult online help for the correct way to use any command: enter "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP
	[command]</strong></font>".
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Command keywords need not be spelled out in full: the first object that will
	match the letters you've given will be used. E.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>KILL PAN</strong></font>" will make
	you try to kill a Panda if you're alone in a room with one. Be careful when
	using nasty commands like <font color="#009933"><strong>KILL</strong></font>, because you might accidentally select an
	undesired target if your keyword is not long enough. (What kind of person would
	kill a Panda anyway?)
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you need to include a space as part of a keyword, enclose the whole phrase
	in single quotes ('), e.g. "<font color="#009933"><strong>CAST 'MAGIC MISSILE' PANDA</strong></font>".
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The MUD server ignores the case of letters when it parses commands, so even
	though commands are written in <strong>ALL-CAPS</strong> in this FAQ and in the online
	help entries, you need not captilize any letters.
