<hr><a name="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[2.1]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What sort of MUD is DD?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	DD uses a heavily modified EnvyMUD 1.0 server; Envy is a DikuMUD variant.
	Envy MUDs are centred on characters gaining experience and power through
	successful combat. DD is also a pkilling MUD [see
	<a href="dd-faq-6.html#10">FAQ 6.10</a>], although
	pkilling is optional.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	DD contains numerous significant changes to the Envy code-base, including a
	rewritten skill system, sub-classing, new races, many new skills and spells, a
	clan system, new areas (mostly original), a quest system, and new currency. Envy
	MUDs have level-based equipment, and there is no rent for saved characters.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There are 100 mortal levels; level 100 characters are 'heroes' with a few
	Immortal skills. Heroes may not 'remort' (begin again as new characters with
	their existing stats or skills).
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	DD is not a strict role-playing MUD, although role-playing is happily
	tolerated. Many players chat about their real-lives and the goings-on in the
	MUD.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[2.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where is the DD server, and when was it set up?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The original DD server, <em>dopey</em>, is based in Hamilton, New Zealand.
	That's not part of Australia for those that think it is! DD1 was setup by a guy
	called Brutus after he finished university and was bumming around. It was the
	second MUD in New Zealand, but was better than the existing one and the players
	and Imms from there moved over to really kick the 'Domain into life. This was
	back in early 1995. DDII was released in March 1996 and contained the
	sub-classes and most of the other major changes from the original Envy MUD. Most
	of the DDII coding was done by Brutus, Jihad and Shade with Brutus adding
	Brawlers, Jihad doing Shifters and Shade the pre-req system.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	DDIII was released in September 1999 and included the Ranger class
	(belatedly), extra tables for players, and changes to the equipment system, and
	numerous other modifications. Most of the coding work on DDIII was done by
	Tavolir, Gezhp and Shade with design and area work done by Danath, Thorne, Owl
	and Hestia.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	In October 2000 the MUD was moved to a server in Auckland, New Zealand, with
	better network access. The server, <em>dd3</em>, was organised by Brutus: Thanks
	B!

<p><font color="#000000">
	The MUD was originally run by Brutus, and was passed to Shade when he went
	into retirment during 1998 due to work commitments (i.e. he got a life!). The
	current Imm staff share the workload around and try to make decisions by
	consensus, including more experienced players. A list of major contributors
	follows:

<p><font color="#000000">
	Players are central to the running of the game. There is a strong oral
	tradition in the Domain: new players are guided by more experienced players, to
	someday assist newbies themselves. The secrets and features of the Domain have
	been passed down from one generation of players to the next. All players in the
	Domain are encouraged to follow this tradition. This does not mean that other
	players must reveal these secrets to you if they don't feel that you earned
	them.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The MUD is a constantly evolving and changing world, and the players in the
	game drive its evolution. The opinions and desires of successful players are
	highly valued by the game's Implementors.
