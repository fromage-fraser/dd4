<p><font color="#000000">
	The following section contains information mostly for players new to MUDding,
	but experienced MUDders new to DD might benefit from quickly scanning through
	the list for any useful entries.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.1]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What do I do here? How do I win?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You find yourself in the middle of a combat-based MUD. The MUD is a virtual
	world containing creatures, places and objects, and you are now a member of it.
	A MUD is a role-playing game where you control the actions of a virtual
	character. How your character interacts with the MUD world is completely up to
	you.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">'Winning' the game requires some sense of why you're playing it. There are
	various 'goals' that your character may choose to complete. Most involve
	improving the abilities of your virtual character; DD is a combat-based MUD, so
	your player improves by gaining 'experience' from exploring dungeons or
	wilderness and then killing monsters. Your character's experience is expressed
	in terms of her 'level'. You start at level 1, and become a 'hero' at level 100.
	Heroes may not level any further, so in one sense, winning involves getting to
	level 100 ('getting to hero').
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	DD is also a pkilling MUD [see
	<a href="dd-faq-6.html#10">FAQ 6.10</a>], and many
	players concentrate on becoming strong and feared pkillers. This can involve
	reaching a certain level of experience and then turning all your attention to
	murdering other players. The best pkillers may have no intention of becoming
	heroes, but 'win' by gaining high pkilling scores [see
	<a href="dd-faq-6.html#13">FAQ 6.13</a>].
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	DD is also a very social MUD, and many players like to login and chat to
	others, team up with them occasionally, with no real hurry to do anything!
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You 'win' the game when you enjoy the time you spend logged in, which can be
	a long time in total; the real goal is to have fun.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"></font></p>
<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I've never played a MUD: what do I do?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You'll need to learn the very basic commands that will let you move about,
	orientate yourself and observe the state of your character and the world. These
	commands will be covered in
	<a href="dd-faq-11.html">Section 11</a>, and you
	should read the rest of this Section very carefully. (You should really read the
	entire FAQ.)
</font></p>
<hr><a name="3"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.3]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where do I get food/drink?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You begin the game in the town 'Midgaard'. Midgaard has a central north/south
	running road, with the Temple at the very north. Head to 'Temple Square' (1
	south from the <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font> square) and there you'll find a fountain. You can
	<font color="#009933"><strong>DRINK</strong></font> from the fountain and <font color="#009933"><strong>FILL</strong></font> any water containers you have.
	You can buy a waterskin from the General Store (1 south, 1 east then 1 north
	from Temple Square). You can buy potpies from the Bakery (1 south, 1 west and 1
	north from Temple Square) if you need something to eat. You can also eat any
	body-parts you hack off from the monsters you manage to kill, so long as they're
	made of flesh and blood.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="4"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.4]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where do I find anything in this town?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The town you are born into is Midgaard. When you <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font>, you appear at
	the 'Temple of Midgaard'. Directly north is the Healer where you can <font color="#009933"><strong>REST</strong></font>
	and <font color="#009933"><strong>SLEEP</strong></font>. There are three Squares directly south: Temple Square, Market
	Square and Common Square. Main roads run east/west through Market and Common
	Squares: you will find most stores and guild houses along these streets. A full
	map of Midgaard is available from the 'Cartography Store' (1 east then 1 north
	from Common Square, enter then type "<font color="#009933"><strong>BUY MIDGAARD</strong></font>").
</font></p>
<hr><a name="5"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where can I get healing?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There are many healers throughout the MUD world, mostly in city temples.
	Midgaard has a healer, directly north from the temple (where you <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font>
	to). He will cast spells to refresh your hit points, mana and moves. You can
	also buy extra curative spells; type <font color="#009933"><strong>HEAL</strong></font> at the healer for further
	information.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="6"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.6]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where can I train or practice?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You automatically train your attributes (strength, etc) as you level [See
	<a href="dd-faq-4.html#1">FAQ 4.1</a>]. You need to
	find the appropriate trainer to learn any skills available to you. Up until
	level 10, that will be the trainer in MUD School (up, north then east from the
	Temple of Midgaard). See <a href="dd-faq-4.html">Section 4</a> of this FAQ
	for more information.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="7"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.7]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where can I find equipment?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Basic equipment is available for sale by various shopkeepers throughout the
	MUD. There are several in Midgaard who sell items for low level characters. See
	the online help entries for <font color="#009933"><strong>BUY</strong></font>, <font color="#009933"><strong>SELL</strong></font> and
	<font color="#009933"><strong>LIST</strong></font> for further information on dealing with shopkeepers.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Most equipment, and all useful artefacts and magical items, are found outside
	of the major cities: you must search outlying areas for these items and
	determine their powers.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="8"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.8]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I'm lost or stuck: help!</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you're in trouble and you need to get back to town quickly then you can
	pray to be transported to the Temple by typing <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font>. You can't recall
	if you are cursed (type <font color="#009933"><strong>AFFECT</strong></font> to check), and you can't recall from some
	rooms. Sometimes, recalling is the only way to leave a room (i.e. it has no
	exits that you can leave through).
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you're stuck wandering around in circles, try drawing a simple map. If you
	think you're lost in a random area, see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#29">FAQ 3.29</a>. If you are
	genuinely trapped and cannot find any way out, ask for another player to come in
	and get you, or an Imm to transfer you back home.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="9"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.9]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I've just been killed! Now what do I do?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Fortunately for you, you get to live again, although you'll lose experience
	and fame for dying. When you die, you end up as a naked soul in Purgatory. Your
	corpse, and all of your belongings, have been transferred to the Reaper, who
	sits at the end of Purgatory. Your corpse has a timer on it, so if you take too
	long to get to it, it'll disappear and you'll have to get all your gear all over
	again. The timer lasts about 20 minutes of real time.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Purgatory had randomized exits, so you'll be wandering all over the place.
	Most players end up with systems that get them out of there pretty quickly. Many
	rooms in Purgatory contain notes; you should read these for clues for a quick
	escape.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	When you get to the end you'll find the Reaper with your corpse. You can
	recover your equipment with "<font color="#009933"><strong>GET ALL CORPSE</strong></font>".
	Note that you'll be able to
	get eq from the corpses of characters who are grouped with you, so be careful to
	avoid mix-ups. Remember your invisible items! The Reaper will be able to help
	you if you can't see invisible items. Can't pick all your gear up? You'll have
	to recast any strength-enhancing spells, and probably need to wear equipment
	with strength bonuses.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can exit Purgatory by heading up from the Reaper. Once you leave, you can
	only return by dying.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="10"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.10]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why doesn't anything listen to me?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Talking to the mobs? They're an antisocial bunch, mostly. There are some
	creatures that respond to specific words and actions, and you'll meet a few
	special ones on your travels. However, 99.99% of creatures are not going to chat
	with you... try slapping them instead.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="11"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.11]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What are MUD clients? Where can I get one?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	MUD clients, or software developed as specific interfaces for MUDs, are
	essential for effective play. There are many clients available; here are some of
	the more popular ones for various platforms:

	There are several options that you can toggle on and off available with the
	<font color="#009933"><strong>AUTO</strong></font> command (see "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP AUTO</strong></font>"). <font color="#009933"><strong>COLOR</strong></font>

<p><font color="#000000">
	You can see who's playing by typing <font color="#009933"><strong>WHO</strong></font>. You can see who's in the same

<p><font color="#000000">
	See the online help entry for <font color="#009933"><strong>GROUP</strong></font> for related commands. To join a

	and more information will be provided to you. Type <font color="#009933"><strong>AFFECT</strong></font> to view what

<p><font color="#000000">
	Someone you can't see, because you're blind or they're invisible. There are
	some invisible and hiding mobs that like to sneak around and grab items. Many
	players like to remain invisible too. See
	<a href="dd-faq-7.html#6">FAQ 7.6</a> if you need to
	know how to detect invis. Immortals are able to go 'wizinvis', so that you'll
	never be able to see them directly, even if you can see normal invisible
	creatures and items. If 'Someone' <font color="#009933"><strong>TELL</strong></font>s you something and you wish to

<hr><a name="19"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.19]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What are 'wimpy' and 'aggro dam', exactly?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">'Wimpy' is the number of hit points you need to be reduced to in order for
	you to start trying to flee from combat automatically. If you set your wimpy to
	zero, you will only try to flee combat by issuing the <font color="#009933"><strong>FLEE</strong></font> command
	explicitly. You cannot set your wimpy value above 20% of your maximum hits (type
	<font color="#009933"><strong>WIMPY</strong></font> without an argument to get this value). You may always try to flee
	from combat by typing <font color="#009933"><strong>FLEE</strong></font>, no matter what your wimpy is set at or
	however many hit points you have.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">'Aggravated damage' or 'aggro dam' is inflicted by certain special attacks,
	e.g. the bite of some vampires. Aggro dam cannot be healed back by spells or
	normal sleeping, and your maximum hits are lowered by the corresponding amount.
	Aggrovated damage heals slowly over time.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="20"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.20]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How do I know what an item does, or figure out what eq to use?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You need to cast the spell 'identify' on an object to learn its properties.
	The Wizard in Midgaard sells scrolls of identify for you to use if you don't
	have the spell. Some fighting classes get the skill 'lore', which lets them
	identify weapons and armour. A few mobs will identify items for a price, e.g.
	the Sage in Anon (just type "<font color="#009933"><strong>IDENTIFY [item keyword]</strong></font>").
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can use the command <font color="#009933"><strong>COMPARE</strong></font> to determine which of two items in
	your inventory would be better to use; see the online help entry for usage. Be
	careful, however, as the <font color="#009933"><strong>COMPARE</strong></font> command does not take into account any
	magical bonuses or effects: it will give you a crude measure of how much damage
	a weapon will do, or how protective a piece of armour is.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="21"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.21]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Help me, I'm blind/cursed/stunned/poisoned!</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you can't see, you've either been blinded, or you've lost your light
	source, or you've entered a dark room without a light source. Check
	<font color="#009933"><strong>AFFECT</strong></font>; if you're not blind, then you need a light from town. If you're
	blind, you need a 'cure blindness' spell. You can <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font> when blind, so
	recalling to Midgaard, heading north, and typing "<font color="#009933"><strong>HEAL BLIND</strong></font>" will
	recover your vision. The Healer will also cast 'cure blindness' periodically
	without charge. If you can't afford to get healing, you have to wait for the
	spell to end (which won't be terribly long), or beg for a player to cure you. If
	you're worried about being attacked while blind, recall to safety.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you're cursed, you won't be able to recall. You need to walk back to town
	for healing at the Temple, unless you are able to remove the curse yourself with
	the appropriate spell or have someone else come out to help you.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you're stunned you're in trouble! Being stunned can mean two things. You
	can either have between 0 and -10 hit points, in which case you get to watch the
	creature you were fighting finish you off, or you were purposely <font color="#009933"><strong>STUN</strong></font>ned,
	usually by another character. In the latter case, you snooze while your opponent
	takes her time to whack you a good one.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you're poisoned, you'll lose a few hits every tick, and lose some
	strength. Loss of strength is cummulative with every poisoning, so you might not
	be able to pick up dropped items, or even get 'cure poison' potions from any
	containers, if you are poisoned repeatedly. You need a 'cure poison' potion or
	spell, or healing from the Midgaard Temple.

<p><font color="#000000">
	A few mobs carry coin, and there are caches of treasure in various areas.
	Most money is made by selling loot at town, and completing random quests [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html">Section 5</a>]. Funds can
	quickly be raised by working through areas with mobs your level carrying plenty
	of eq, and selling this eq once you've murdered them.

	directions to most areas, check the DD website. There are maps to some areas

<p><font color="#000000">
	The items you are trying to equip have alignment restrictions on them (try
	identifying them). To wear them, you need to change to a compatable alignment
	[see <a href="dd-faq-3.html#25">FAQ 3.25</a>].
	There is no way to remove the restrictions from these items.

<hr><a name="25"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[3.25]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How do I change my alignment?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You need to kill mobs of alignment opposite to that you wish to have. This
	can take a little time if you have to change drastically. The spells 'detect
	evil' and 'detect good' will help you identify target mobs, else take an
	educated guess. Goblins south of Midgaard will be evil; town-dwellers are often
	good.

<p><font color="#000000">
	You need to be pardoned by an Immortal. They will usually let you off if you
	gain the flag accidentally. They may not remove it immediately if you have
	repeatedly gotten into trouble, or have been particularly careless. If you gain
	the flag after a calculated act of thievery or violence you may wear it for a
	significant period of time, and you will need to prove to the Imms that you
	deserve to be pardoned.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Thieves and killers will be attacked by all guard mobs and will not be served
	by shopkeepers. They are also hunted by Grail the Hunter [see

	You can <font color="#009933"><strong>CONSIDER</strong></font> a mob and judge by the response as to how much
	trouble you might have killing it; <font color="#009933"><strong>CONSIDER</strong></font> measures the difference in
	level between you and the target. It pays to <font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK</strong></font> at the mob too; mobs
	with equipment, weapons and staves most obviously, are significantly harder to
	kill and may inflict greater damage. Be wary of any similar mobs in the
	immediate area: they may join in the fight if they wander in.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Expect particular enemies to produce special attacks: snakes may poison,
	dragons might have a breath weapon, undead are nasty, wizards and clerics will
	likely cast spells. Many of these attacks can be very dangerous!

	You may be cursed, in which case God will not transport you. There are rooms
	from which you can't recall either; some areas are almost entirely 'no-recall'
	for added danger.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you are a member of a clan, you will lose your Midgaard recall when you
	reach level 41. You will have to walk to Midgaard, or buy a Midgaard recall

	Some rooms have their exits jumbled so that you have no idea which direction
	you're really heading in (Purgatory, Shadow Grove, the Great Easten Desert,
	etc). If you're lucky enough to have the skill 'hunt', then you can sniff out a
	known mob at the other end of the area, otherwise you'll need a little nous and
	a lot of luck.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Generally, try "<font color="#009933"><strong>LOOK [direction]</strong></font>" and <font color="#009933"><strong>EXITS</strong></font> for anything
	obvious. Try <font color="#009933"><strong>SCAN</strong></font> to see if you can see any mobs you might like to get
	to. Pay attention to the room description; there are tricks to getting through
	many of these areas, as you will eventually discover. Try dropping a coin or two
	to leave a marker. Don't dispair, you'll be able to get through without too much
	trouble (unless you're in the Yew Forest, in which case you're doomed).

<p><font color="#000000">
	Areas are located near cities where players of similar level ought to be
