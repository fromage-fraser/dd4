<p><font color="#000000">
	DD tries to keep a relaxed atmosphere, where people can have fun and talk as
	well as put in some serious adventuring. Use of the 'chat' channel has not been
	restricted, and never will be. Players are expected to refrain from using
	offensive language or gestures in 'public'. Imms will warn then <font color="#009933"><strong>SILENCE</strong></font>
	characters who get out of hand. Otherwise, wise-cracking and good-natured
	making-fun-of-people is tolerated (sometimes encouraged!).
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Try "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP RULES</strong></font>" and "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP LANGUAGE</strong></font>"
	for some additional guidelines.

<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I stop all these players from talking on the 'chat' channel and spoiling my MUD experience?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Turn off your access to the chat channel. See the help entry for
	<font color="#009933"><strong>CHANNEL</strong></font>. You may customize which channels you will hear using this
	command.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You may also use the commands <font color="#009933"><strong>QUIET</strong></font> and <font color="#009933"><strong>TELLMODE</strong></font> to gag out
	messages. <font color="#009933"><strong>QUIET</strong></font> toggles whether you hear CHATs, MUSICs, INFOs, AUCTIONs
	and SHOUTs or not; <font color="#009933"><strong>TELLMODE</strong></font> prevents people from messaging you directly
	using <font color="#009933"><strong>TELL</strong></font>. Immortals will always be able to <font color="#009933"><strong>TELL</strong></font> you things even
	if you have turned off the TELL channel.

<hr><a name="3"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.3]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What's 'tanking'? Can I use my higher level character to help out my lower level character?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">'Tanking' most often involves a strong character absorbing damage or
	partially damaging or disabling targets so that weaker characters may gain
	experience. This is not always bad, e.g. grouped characters often discuss who
	will 'tank' during the next fight. Tanking is bad when it involves a serious
	level difference between the 'tanker' and the character to benefit, i.e. the two
	characters could not normally group together. It is considered cheating and
	punishable if discovered. Tanking includes crippling, disabling, trapping,
	dispelling, or any harmful modification of a mob for a lower-level character to
	kill.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	When tanking becomes unreasonable, it becomes illegal. Higher level
	characters should not accompany lower-level characters on experience gathering
	trips. The Imms reserve the right to decide what is reasonable and what isn't.
	Note this may differ from Imm to Imm: if in doubt, don't do it!

<hr><a name="4"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.4]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why won't player X get me some eq, or tell me how to do this or that, or where something is? How can I make her?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Player X is under no obligation to help you. If you ask politely, she may
	give you clues towards finding what you're looking for. Players are encouraged
	to explore the MUD and find the good equipment and the good areas for
	themselves. Many players are happy to give advice, but won't always lead you
	there by the nose, preferring to give you some general clues. A few players are
	soft-touches and might even get you what you want themselves, if you're lucky.
	There are many directions to areas on the website, and this FAQ contains many
	tips.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	To understand why people might be reluctant to help you involves an idea of
	what it means to be a good player. Experienced, high-level players with good eq
	have earned their position; they know the MUD and all of its features because
	they've explored it. That's not to say that they haven't had any help along the
	way, of course, but that they've made the effort to figure out the various
	puzzles as they encounter them. These players aren't in desperate trouble when
	all their eq gets disintegrated, because it's a straight-forward matter to
	recover it all again. This is the sort of player you should be trying to become.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Of course, if you are rude, or pester people, or expect and demand that they
	help you, you probably won't get the response you desire.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="5"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Player X keeps breaking the rules! What can I do?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Short of tell them what you think, you need to talk or write a note to an
	Immortal. Various game commands are logged, but many rules require players'
	co-operation.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="6"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.6]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Player X is rude and abusive to me. How can I stop this harassment?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If the abuse is serious and constant, and you've complained to the other
	player and asked her to stop, and you can't/won't block it out, then you need to
	get in touch with an Imm, who will deal with the offender accordingly.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="7"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.7]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I multiplay? How many characters may I have on at a time?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Multiplaying, or controlling more than one character on the MUD at once, is
	allowed in some situations. Multiplaying restrictions exist to prevent tanking
	and other abuses. See "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP MULTI</strong></font>" for current rules concerning
	multiplaying.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The golden rule is that you are not allowed to have more than two characters on at once. These two characters cannot be in the field together, for whatever reason. There are no exceptions. Standing at a questmaster or in a major town does not count as being in the field.</font></p>
<hr><a name="8"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.8]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I think I'm crashing the MUD!</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You either enter a command and the MUD immediately crashes, or as soon as you
	enter your name to log in, you get cut off for no apparent reason. In the first
	case, alert the MUD and any Imms that you might have crashed the MUD, and some
	detective work will begin. If you are constantly cut off upon login, you might
	be bringing down the MUD. Please don't try a million times to get back on: try
	to log in with another character (make a new one if you have to) and talk or
	write a note to an Imm, who will sort it out.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="9"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.9]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The MUD crashed while I was in Purgatory, and now I have no eq! What do I do?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	This happens occasionally. Generally, you will have to recover your equipment
	by yourself; other players may help you as they desire. If an Immortal is
	online, then they will probably give you some equipment to help you get going
	again. You may not demand to have your equipment restored, even though it may
	seem unfair. Exceptions will be made if your case is particularly
	depressing.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="10"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.10]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why is everyone so unfriendly? Why doesn't player X reply to me? You people suck!</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Not every player feels like talking. Also, if you expect to get help, you
	need to be polite, and not nag. If someone tells you to 'check the website',
	'read the FAQ' or see 'help X' then you'll just have to do it. Most players will
	help people who are prepared to help themselves.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Some players turn off many talk channels, so they may not even hear you. If
	the people who play DD are so intolerable, you'll just have to find another MUD
	to play.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Most players are friendly. We don't think we suck. :)
</font></p>
<hr><a name="11"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.11]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>My brother logged in as my character and did something mean and/or stupid. How can I get things back to normal?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Tough luck! You need to protect your password and punch your brother.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="12"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.12]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What's so great about a 'reboot'?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Every time a particular mob gets killed, less experience is rewarded to the
	characters who kill it next time it resets. When the MUD server is rebooted, the
	tally of how often each kind of mob has died is erased, and experience rewarded
	jumps back up. Reboots will also reset all equipment, doors and items.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="13"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.13]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why does everyone chat 'gratz'?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">'Gratz' or 'grats' is a contraction of 'congratulations'.
	It's traditionally
	chatted after a character gains a level, fame or gets a great pkill.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="14"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[8.14]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Arrgh! I keep trying to change to a sub-class but it just doesn't work!</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	When you change, you need to specify the 3-letter class name abbreviation,
	not the full class name. The 3-letter codes are:
