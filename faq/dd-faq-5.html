<hr><a name="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.1]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What are quests? What are quest points?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Quests are a way to earn money, prizes, useful artefacts and esteem. There
	are three kinds of quests available on DD, and all involve characters
	attempting to complete specific tasks and then receiving a reward upon success.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can ask for special quests from the Jeweller in Midgaard (enter his store
	and "<font color="#009933"><strong>SAY QUEST</strong></font>") or from the Adventurer's Guild. The Guild can be found
	east from Temple Square in Midgaard; ask for help at Reception. These quests are
	non-random and produce specific items and fame as rewards.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	DD also has a randomized quest system, administered by several 'questmaster'
	mobs [see <a href="dd-faq-5.html#2">FAQ 5.2</a>].
	These quests involve killing a specific mob or retrieving a specific object
	within a certain time limit. You are rewarded 'quest points', gold, fame and
	occassionally physical pracs for the successful completion of these quests. It
	is important to gain quest points as you level: you can spend quest points to
	obtain additional recall points [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html#6">FAQ 5.6</a>], and must
	reach various targets in order to level your character [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html#5">FAQ 5.5</a>].
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The third kind of quest involves Immortals granting specific missions to
	specific characters, or running games or competitions [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html#7">FAQ 5.7</a>].
</font></p>
<hr><a name="4"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.4]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The questmaster has given me an impossible quest!</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Yes, this does happen. Quests can be impossible in a good way and in a bad
	way. The questmaster will sometimes give you a particularly tough mob to kill,
	or place an item in an area that is filled with dangerous mobs a lot higher
	level than you. This is okay: the quest is too difficult for you and you need to
	default (type "<font color="#009933"><strong>QUEST ABORT</strong></font>" to cancel the quest).
	You can't save the world every time!
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Sometimes, quests are given that are actually impossible, not merely too
	difficult: the item or mob indicated is located in a room that cannot be
	accessed by a mortal character. You need to abort these quests as you come to
	recognise them (other players will let you know). The quest system is being
	refined to prevent this sort of quest from being given, but expect it to occur
	from time to time.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="5"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why do I need quest points?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You need to have earned a certain number of quest points in order to reach
	certain levels. Type "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP QP LEVEL</strong></font>" for a summary. E.g. you need 1 point
	to get to level 31, and 1500 points to become a hero. Note that the total number
	of quest points you have earned is considered, not your current number.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="6"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.6]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How do I buy and use recall points?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can buy recall points from a questmaster. Type "<font color="#009933"><strong>QUEST LIST</strong></font>" for a
	list, and "<font color="#009933"><strong>QUEST BUY [recall point]</strong></font>" to buy.
	Type "<font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL LIST</strong></font>" to
	see a list of recall points available to you. An asterisk (*) indicates where
	you will recall to when you issue the <font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL</strong></font> command.
	Type "<font color="#009933"><strong>RECALL SET [number]</strong></font>" to change the recall location.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	ZMud users note that Zmud sets up a default alias called 'recall' and you'll
	need to disable this if you intend to type the full command.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="7"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.7]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Do Imms sometimes give special quests?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	They do on occassion. Immortals may give particular characters a hard quest
	for them to complete for a specific reward. The reward is often very nice: a
	powerful artefact or a skill or spell not normally available to them. These
	quests are usually reserved for higher-level characters. Sometimes, quests must
	be completed in order to prove a character's worth to the Immortals, so that
	they can lift some form of punishment (e.g. removal of a KILLER flag). Approach
	an Immortal if you feel you deserve a difficult quest; do not expect to receive
	one immediately (nor ever)!
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Many Imms like to hold games and competitions, and these may happen fairly
	frequently. They are usually not very hard and involve many people racing about.
	These 'quests' can take many forms, and are rewarded with something small but
	nice, e.g. a lovely potion, or a little fame, or an item a few levels lower than
	you might find it normally. If there's a bored-looking Immortal lurking about,
	ask for a quick quest, and you all may get one.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="8"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.8]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What's fame? What does it do or mean?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Fame is a measure of how well known an adventurer's exploits are. If you have
	high fame, you receive a discount whenever you buy something from a shopkeeper.
	Apart from this, there is no other tangible benefit to having fame. Famous
	characters do enjoy a certain prestige among players, and no-one likes to lose
	fame for any reason.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Type <font color="#009933"><strong>FAME</strong></font> for a list of those currently famous, and <font color="#009933"><strong>LEGEND</strong></font> for
	a list of those holding all-time records.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="9"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.9]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How do I gain or lose fame?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You gain fame by killing mobs much higher than you in level (over 5 levels
	difference), killing some special mobs and by completing quests. You may also be
	granted fame on odd occassions by Immortals (e.g. special quest rewards). You
	can lose fame by fleeing or recalling from combat and by killing some
	shopkeepers. You lose half of your fame when you die.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="10"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.10]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What happens if I have fame below zero?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You will not be able to level and you will not be served by shopkeepers.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="11"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[5.11]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Do any classes gain bonus points when they complete random quests?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Knights and Templars gain a +25% quest point bonus when they complete random
	quests at Questmasters.
