<hr><a name="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.1]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What are clans?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Clans are groups of characters who share a particular philosophy and have
	banded together for friendship, protection and mutual support. New clans are
	formed on occassion, and old ones are sometimes disbanded; there are usually
	four or five clans active at any one time. The DD website contains information
	about the various clans.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Belonging to a clan allows you to become a pkiller [see
	<a href="dd-faq-6.html#10">FAQ 6.10</a>]. This means
	that you will be able to murder other players who belong to clans, and <strong>can
	also be murdered yourself</strong>.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">

	Currently, in DD4, there are no active clans.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	See the help entries for <font color="#009933"><strong>CLANS</strong></font> and "<font color="#009933"><strong>CLAN COMMANDS</strong></font>".
</font></p>
<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Do I have to join a clan?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	No. You must join a clan or become ronin (see
	<a href="dd-faq-6.html#8">FAQ 6.8</a>) if you wish
	to pkill other players. If you don't wish to pkill, you can still join a clan,
	but you will be able to be pkilled by other players.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="3"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.3]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How do I join a clan?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You need to talk to the clan members and ask to join. A clan leader or
	high-ranking member will normally need to approve. You may need to convince the
	clan that you will be a worthy member: the policies of the various clans differ.
	You cannot force a clan to let you join.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Each clan has its own help entry online: type "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP [clan code]</strong></font>" for
	more information.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="4"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.4]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of being in a clan?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Being a clannie confers several advantages. Clans have headquarters hidden
	throughout the MUD. These headquarters are protected and have their own healers.
	Clans also have special pieces of equipment available to each member; these
	items contain good health and combat bonuses. Clan members can transport
	themselves directly to their headquarters using the <font color="#009933"><strong>HOME</strong></font> command. Each
	clan also has their own healing item, which improves the rate of healing for all
	those in the room. Clan items can be stolen from other clans and hoarded.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The most important change is the granting of permission to pkill. Members of
	one clan are vulnerable to being murdered by members of every other clan: very
	few locations in the MUD are safe for clannies. Clan members also lose their
	ability to recall to Midgaard after level 30, and must quest to regain it.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="5"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>When can I join a clan?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can join a clan at any time after level 19 and until you reach level 41.</font></p>
<hr><a name="6"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.6]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I've just decided that I really want to join a clan, but I'm too high level: is there anyway I can get in?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	No. Ignorance of this rule is no excuse.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="7"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.7]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I leave my clan? Can I join another clan?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can leave your clan by using the <font color="#009933"><strong>LEAVE</strong></font> command. This will
	immediately remove your clanned status. Your clan equipment will disappear as
	soon as you leave.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Once you leave, you are invisibly flagged as a 'clan deserter'. You will not
	be able to be guilded by leaders of other clans if you are a deserter: you must
	petition an Immortal to guild you. Generally, once you leave and start to
	adventure, you will not be let back into any clan.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="8"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.8]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What are ronin characters? How do I become ronin?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Ronin are clanless characters who lose the benefits of a clan head-quarters
	and clan equipment, but are otherwise legal pkillers. Clanned players and other
	ronin may legally attack a ronin character; ronin characters may legally attack
	clanned players and other ronin.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Characters used to become ronin after leaving their clan without the
	permission of their leader, but now ronin status is granted exclusively by the
	Immortals. You must petition the Imms if you wish to become ronin and provide
	good reasons: irreconcilable differences with your existing clan, proven
	experience as a pkiller, etc. Your character needn't have been a clan member
	previously before becoming ronin.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	To avoid possible conflicts of interest, once one of your characters becomes
	ronin, ALL of your existing clanned characters must leave their clans or become
	ronin too. You may not guild ANY of your characters to clans while you have
	ronin players. All of your ronin characters must hand in or destroy any clan
	equipment they have.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="9"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.9]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I start up my own clan? What do I have to do?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you satisfy the Immortal community that you can organise one. You need to
	have a character of your own at least level 50 and have one or more players (not
	characters!) willing to join. You'll need to propose the clan's basic philosophy
	and background, and think about what the headquarters may look like. Talk to an
	Imm or a clan leader for more advice. There is also a practical limit to the
	number of clans that can be active at any one time.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There are several features of your clan that you need to finalise:
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	<strong>Clan Headquarters</strong><br>

	You are encouraged to build your own
	headquarters. If you don't know how to build areas please refer to the Building
	section on the website for more information. If you don't want to build your
	headquarters then the Imms will design a basic area for you, but beware: it will
	be small and simple! Clan headquarters should not be larger than half a dozen or so
	rooms, and the Imms reserve the right to make alterations as they desire. You
	should chat to the Imms for more specific information about what can and can't
	be incorporated into clan headquarters.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Clan headquarters contain special mobs and rooms. You need at least two mobs:
	one clan healer and one clan guard. The clan guard has the ability to attack
	intruders who penetrate the headquarters; the guard stands at the entrance to
	your clan. When you design your area, you must indicate which mobs are your
	healer and clan guard; you also need to indicate which room clan members will
	appear in when they recall to the clan using <font color="#009933"><strong>HOME</strong></font>, which room the clan
	guard stands in, and which room the healer stands in. If you do not provide this
	information properly, bad things can happen (your healing item won't work, your
	guard attacks you, and so on).
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	<strong>Clan Ranks</strong><br>

	There are three clan ranks to indicate a character's
	status within the clan. The names of the ranks must be chosen by the clan
	designers; the higher the rank, the more status the character has. Clan leaders
	can promote and demote clan members as they desire. How ranks are awarded is
	determined by the clan; usually people gain ranks as they reach specific numbers
	of pkills or gain a certain number of pkill points.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	<strong>Clan Equipment</strong><br>

	Clans receive special equipment to improve their
	combat statistics and healing times: see
	<a href="dd-faq-6.html#17">FAQ 6.17</a>. When
	designing your clan you must decide what bonuses each of the items will have:
</font></p>

	Clan items may only be worn in the following positions (except for
	beltpouchs): body, head, legs, feet, hands, arm, shield, about body, about
	waist. The level 20 and level 30 items <em>must</em> be worn in the same location.
	You should choose a different location for your level 60 item.

<hr><a name="10"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.10]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What is pkilling?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The murder of characters by other characters. This type of kill gives the
	murderer a KILLER flag unless both she and the victim are clan members or ronin,
	or the murder takes place in the Arena [see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#32">FAQ 3.32</a>].
</font></p>
<hr><a name="11"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.11]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What are the rules regarding pkilling?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The MUD enforces some level limits on pkilling other characters as some form
	of protection on lower level players. These limits are spelt out in <strong>HELP
	PKILL RULES</strong>. There are restrictions on multiplay and pkill: please refer to
	"<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP MULTIPLAY</strong></font>" for these.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There are also some rules that are not enforced by the game with regards to
	killing the same player multiple times. You cannot pkill the same character
	twice without them having gained 5 levels ('spam killing'), unless they have a
	FINAL pkill score greater than zero (seen on their <font color="#009933"><strong>WHOIS</strong></font> information), or
	they attack you, or they are inside YOUR clan headquarters.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="12"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[6.12]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Are there any safe places where I can't be pkilled?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Yes. Midgaard city is safe, including the MUD School and the Donation Temple.
	Most trainers are also safe, as are recall points and questors. Clan HQs are not
	safe, but they do have a tough level 60 guard by the front door.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can use the command <font color="#009933"><strong>SAFE</strong></font> to check whether you are safe from being
	pkilled in your current location. You can also make your prompt display whether
	you are personally safe and whether the room you are in is safe in general. See
	help entries for <font color="#009933"><strong>SAFE</strong></font> and <font color="#009933"><strong>PROMPT</strong></font>.

<p><font color="#000000">
	Once you have a few pkills under your belt, your pkill score is one
	reflection of how succesful you are. Killing people around your own level most
	of the time will give you an average of 2-3 points per kill. Above or below this
	is some indication of how successful you are. If you see someone with a lot of
	kills and a high rating (see below), watch out!
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can find out which pkillers have the most points by viewing the pkill
	score table (type <font color="#009933"><strong>PKILLERS</strong></font>). This table lists the top 20 pkillers, the
	number of people they have killed and the number of points they have gained.
	Also included is their 'rating', calculated from the average number of points
	gained per kill. The ratings, from highest to lowest, are: <em>Slayer</em>,
	<em>Predator</em>, <em>Assassin</em>, <em>Hunter</em>, <em>Stalker</em>, <em>Brigand</em>,
	and <em>Coward</em>. Killing people your level will give you a rating of
	<em>Stalker</em>.

<p><font color="#000000">
	There is nothing to stop people doing this if they want to, but they have to
	catch you first! The <font color="#009933"><strong>WHERE</strong></font> and <font color="#009933"><strong>WHO</strong></font> commands are very useful in
	pkill to see who is on and who's in the same area as you. The golden rule of
	self preservation: recall or attack first, ask questions later! The other way is
	to ask for help from either your clanmates or an allied clan. You can get
	someone your predator's level on to keep them in line.

<p><font color="#000000">
	Yes, although you'll need to get past the tough level 60 clan guard, who will

	artefacts is fairly common.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">
	Clans have special worn items to improve combat statistics such as damroll,
	hits and mana (see
	<a href="dd-faq-6.html#9">FAQ 6.9</a> for what items and bonuses may be used).
	Clan items are created and
	distributed by clan leaders using the <font color="#009933"><strong>OCLANITEM</strong></font> command (see the online
	help entry).
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Clans also have unique healing items. Only one of these items is loaded for
	each clan when the MUD is rebooted. The clan healing items each accelerate the
	healing of all those in the same room as it; these items can be stolen by other
	clans, but cannot be destroyed or sacrificed. Clan healing items will only work

	<em>Anything</em> goes in pkill! If it is within the rules, then it's fair.
	Players are encouraged to pkill 'fairly', but a rogue pkiller or two adds a
	certain excitement to the game. Spam-killing will not be tolerated, however. If
