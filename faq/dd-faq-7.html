	You need to digest the contents of this FAQ, especially <a href="dd-faq-3.html">Section 3</a>,
	<a href="dd-faq-7.html">Section 7</a> and
	<a href="dd-faq-11.html">Section 11</a>. After
	familiarising yourself with basic survival and movement throughout the world,
	you should carefully read Sections 4-6 before trying to increase in level.

<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where are some areas good for newbies?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There are a few places you can try, close to or inside Midgaard:
</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			The MUD School Arena <em>(Open south from the Entrance to MUD School)</em>
			<br>

			You can kill the mobs here to get to 2nd or 3rd level without too much danger. Head upwards to
			escape.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			The Dwarven Daycare <em>(6 east, down and south from Market Square)</em>
			<br>
			More mobs to kill for those under level 5. Double check before attacking the Nannies.
			There is eq here [see <a href="dd-faq-7.html#4">FAQ 7.4</a>].
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			The Foundry <em>(3 west and northwards from Market Square)</em>
			<br>
			For under-5's. A few aggressive mobs here, but some eq you will want.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			The Shire
			<em>(5 west then northwards from Market Square)</em>
			<br>
			A little tougher.  Some eq here.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			The Rat's Lair
			<em>(East and down from Common Square)</em>
			<br>
			For those level 3 and higher.  Some poisonous mobs, and a few nasty creatures at the bottom,
			so be careful.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			The Circus
			<em>(Southwards from Inside the Eastern Gate)</em>
			<br>
			Nice levelling area for newbies, and some good eq.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Dangerous Neighbourhood
			<em>(2 south, then east from Inside East Gate)</em>
			<br>
			A range of mobs for level-4's and higher. Good for levelling.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			The Lemming Caves
			<em>(7 west, 2 south, 2 west and south from Market Square)</em>
			<br>
			For those over level 5 and not too feeble.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Other newbie and low-level areas include:
			Ambush, The Sewer, The Wyvern's Tower, Troll Den, Arachnos, Goblin Caves,
			Gnome Village, Valley of the Elves, Elemental Canyon, and Ultima (lower
			levels).
		</font></p>

	</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Check the website for directions; use the <font color="#009933"><strong>AREA</strong></font> command for a list of
	areas (try "<font color="#009933"><strong>AREA [your level]</strong></font>").
</font></p>
<hr><a name="3"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.3]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where are the Smurfs?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The Smurfs are DEAD! You won't have to put up with their horrible blue faces
	and inane singing any longer! The Smurf Village has been replaced by the
	Foundry, which contains the eqivalent of Brainy's glasses and Smurfette's
	necklace, and which isn't so <em>naff</em>.

	(*) These items will be difficult to get if you are inexperienced; you'll
	need to convince a higher-level player to make the trip for you.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="5"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I keep dying. What can I do?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you are a new player you may find yourself dying a significant number of
	times per level. Make sure you are not being too reckless when you attack
	creatures: learn how to judge what mobs you can safely kill using
	<font color="#009933"><strong>CONSIDER</strong></font> [see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#27">FAQ 3.27</a>]. Be careful
	of wandering creatures that may attack you.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you are being fairly cautious, consider levelling in an easier area of the
	MUD, or where there are fewer aggressive or otherwise dangerous creatures about
	[see <a href="dd-faq-7.html#2">FAQ 7.2</a> for a
	list of some low-level areas]. If you are playing a non-fighting class, such as
	a Psionic or a Mage, you might like to start again as a stronger fighting class,
	such as a Warrior or Shapeshifter. Consider whether your equipment and weaponary
	are good for your level. See if you can group together with a more experienced
	player or players for safety and experience. Reset your 'wimpy' threshold to
	maximum (type <font color="#009933"><strong>WIMPY</strong></font>; see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#19">FAQ 3.19</a>). Keep your
	beltpouch full of healing potions or pills. Avoid starting combat or heading
	into unknown territory with low hit points. Be careful where you choose to sleep
	or rest if you must heal in the field.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	It can be hard for new players to avoid numerous deaths, especially if they
	are playing spell-casting classes. Prudence, good judgement and care are needed
	if you want to survive to your next level.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="6"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.6]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I detect invisible or hidden things?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you don't have the appropriate spells, or the skill 'heighten senses',
	then the Wizard in Midgaard sells potions of see invisible. Poultices sold by
	the Wizard in the Mirror Realm can also help.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="7"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.7]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I become invisible? How do I become visible again?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can cast the spell 'invis' or get potions of invisibility, found on your
	way to the Elemental Canyon (see the website for directions). Type
	<font color="#009933"><strong>VISIBLE</strong></font> to become visible again.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="8"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.8]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I get across a river, climb up a cliff, or fly?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	To get across a body of deep water, you must be flying or have a boat. You
	can buy boats from the Levee in Midgaard. To climb up a cliff or wall you need
	the 'climb' skill or must fly. In order to fly, you need to cast the spell
	'fly', have the 'flight' skill if your race can fly (type
	<font color="#009933"><strong>FLY</strong></font>), or get a potion of flight from the Wizard in Midgaard.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="9"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.9]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where can I get a good weapon?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There is general agreement as to which weapons are the best for any given
	level: you will come to learn what these weapons are as you observe and talk to
	other characters on the MUD. If you are a low-level character, flamberges and
	nildaeths from Draagdim have nice bonuses [see
	<a href="dd-faq-7.html#4">FAQ 7.4</a>].
</font></p>
<hr><a name="10"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.10]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Can I get higher level characters to get me eq?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Getting higher level characters to get equipment for others is considered
	okay if it's for new characters. Newbies are not expected to make the trips to
	different towns safely. Characters 10 levels and above are expected to be able
	to get all of their own gear. See
	<a href="dd-faq-8.html#3">FAQ 8.3</a> for relevent comments.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="11"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.11]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I'm having real trouble in Purgatory; how do I find my corpse?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Purgatory is a random area, but not so bad as they go. Keep an eye out for
	notes in the rooms you pass through: they will quickly lead you to your
	corpse.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="12"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.12]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I identify eq?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	If you don't have the spell, you need to buy scrolls of 'identify' from the
	Wizard in Midgaard. Some fighting classes gain the skill 'lore', which allows
	weapons and armour to be identified. Some mobs will identify your equipment for
	a price, e.g. the Sage in Anon; type "<font color="#009933"><strong>IDENTIFY [item]</strong></font>" at the mob to have
	your items appraised.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="13"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.13]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Is there anything that I should find or any quest I should complete while I am low level?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You should try to get the eq listed in
	<a href="dd-faq-7.html#4">FAQ 7.4</a>. Generally you
	want gear that maximises your constitution, wisdom and intelligence to wear just
	before your level, so that you receive good hit point and practice bonuses. You
	needn't wear this eq during most of the level.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The Jeweller in Midgaard runs a quest for newbies. Also, the Midgaard
	questmaster Suturb will not give quests to players above level 20; you will need
	at least 1 quest point to be allowed to reach level 31 [see
	<a href="dd-faq-5.html">Section 5</a> of this FAQ].
</font></p>
<hr><a name="14"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.14]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How do I change my title from 'is a newbie'?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Enter "<font color="#009933"><strong>TITLE [new title]</strong></font>". To force your title blank, type
	<font color="#009933"><strong>TITLE</strong></font>. You may incorporate colour into your title:
	see "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP ANSI2</strong></font>".
</font></p>
<hr><a name="15"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.15]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I carry more stuff?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The number of items you can carry is controlled by your dexterity. The total
	weight of items you can carry is controlled by you strength. You need to
	increase either or both of these attributes in order to carry more items. Type
	<font color="#009933"><strong>SCORE</strong></font> to see the number and weight of items carried. Items inside
	containers do not add to your numerical limit, so you will be able to increase
	the number of things you carry by using containers.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="16"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.16]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>How can I steal?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You can steal items or coins using the <font color="#009933"><strong>STEAL</strong></font> command (see the online
	help entry), but you won't be successful unless you have the specific thief
	skill. You will also get a THIEF flag if you try to steal off another player,
	unless you are both clanned or ronin [see
	<a href="dd-faq-3.html#26">FAQ 3.26</a>]. You may
	not steal if you're in the arena, and you may only steal from victims within
	your pkilling range.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="17"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.17]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Where can I get a pet?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Pets can be bought from the Pet Store in Midgaard, eastwards from Common
	Square. You can buy one per level. Other shopkeepers may sell pets also.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="18"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[7.18]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Is the EQ here level based or something?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	It sure is. Items carried by mobs are usually 2 levels lower than the level
	of their owner. You cannot equip an item above your level, and any items in your
	inventory higher in level than you will be transferred to the Donation Temple
	when you quit.
