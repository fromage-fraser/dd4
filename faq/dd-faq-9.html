	Discussion on class and race selection by Shade.

<hr><a name="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[9.1]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What is the best race?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There is no best race, but some races are clearly more suited to some classes
	than others and this information can be found in "<font color="#009933"><strong>HELP RACE</strong></font>". In general,
	you should try to pick a race that complements your class otherwise you might
	find it a bit of a struggle to level at some stages of your characters
	career.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[9.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What is the best class?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	There is no best class either! But we're sure you'll find ones you like more
	than others. The classes can roughly be broken down into fighting types and
	casting types, and most players will prefer either a fighter type or a caster
	type. Once you find out which type you are, you'll probably find a class or
	classes you like the most--these are <em>your</em> best classes.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="3"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[9.3]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I want to pkill: what class should I be?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Pkilling players generally fall into two categories: 'toughs' and
	'predators'. Toughs are characters that openly target their victims and rely on
	the brute force approach. Warriors, brawlers, shapeshifters and to a lesser
	extent mages are good classes for toughs. Predators are characters that use a
	more stealthy approach to pkilling and try to take their victims by surprise.
	Thieves and vampires are good predator classes.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Most classes are capable of pkilling in the right circumstances, although it
	is fair to say that for some classes its harder to get the right circumstances
	than others. For a warrior, almost any circumstance is the right one, for a
	psionic you'll really want to catch your victim with their pants down (so to
	speak :)
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	You'll want to take this into account before you start pkilling, and before
	you start taking people on in the arena. You have to be pretty brave to take on
	a fully tanked warrior who knows your coming for them!
</font></p>
<hr><a name="4"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[9.4]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>X has a stronger character than me! Its not fair!</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Firstly it is a requirement of the game that all classes are equal for
	leveling purposes. For pkilling, it is goal that all classes are equal but we
	acknowledge some classes are not really well setup for pkilling. To answer this
	though, we need to define what we mean by equal as it isn't exactly what a lot
	of people think it is. Our defintion of equal is:
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	<em>Classes must be of approximately equal strength in the time and skill
		needed to move from level 1 to HERO.</em>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	This means that at some levels, X will be stronger than you and at other
	levels you will be stronger than X; at some levels you will level faster than X
	and at some levels X will level faster than you. It is the overall balance that
	we are aiming to achieve.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Let's look at an example of warriors and mages from level 1 to 100. This is
	roughly how we see the classes strengths at the various levels:
</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			<strong>Under level 25</strong>
			<br>
			Warriors much stronger. 3 attacks, good damage,
			plenty of hit points give the warrior a clear edge.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			<strong>Levels 25-40</strong>
			<br>
			Pretty even (warriors slightly better maybe). The
			warrior doesn't get much more than as above, but a mage gets 2nd spell, acid
			blast to good %s and gets brandish sanctuary items for extra protection.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			<strong>Levels 40-50</strong>
			<br>
			Warrior stronger. Warrior gets 4th attack and
			enhanced hit and only two spells for mages starts to make things a bit harder.
			Plenty of good eq for fighters during these levels as well.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			<strong>Levels 50-65</strong>
			<br>
			Warrior (just). Dual wield--says it all really.
			Mages get third spell and globe which are good, but not good enough to get
			past dual.
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			<strong>Above level 65</strong>
			<br>
			By 65 a mage has 4th spell, prismatic spray to
			100% and will start racing up the levels. Mobs get a lot tougher and warriors
			start to struggle to hit them whereas spells don't miss much.
		</font></p><p><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"></font></font></p><font color="#000000">
	</font><p></p>

	</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">
	So in summary, for levels 1-65 it's a warrior, above that it's a mage. That
	might not look to even, but ask in hero which takes longer level 1-65 or
	65-HERO, and you'll see that the Mage is actually a bit better.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	So to answer your question, yes X might well be stronger than you but either
	you've had some previous levels where you've been stronger, or you'll turn will
	come :)
