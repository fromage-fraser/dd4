<hr><a name="1"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[12.1]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Why a Guide to pkilling?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Mainly to dispel a few myths about pkill and to help those that have just
	joined a clan avoid being a walking corpse :) The pkilling clans generally don't
	let in those that haven't proven themselves already and aren't going to rush out
	and help people not in their clan -- funny that. This guide is here for those
	that want to start pkilling but don't know where to start.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="2"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[12.2]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What makes a good pkiller?</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Generally the more successful you have been as a player before starting on
	your pkilling career the better you'll do. Why is this I hear you ask? Well
	there are several factors that I consider make a good pkiller. Some of these are
	listed below, and you'll see that the longer you've been playing the more likely
	you are to meet these criteria.
</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Combat equipment relevent to *your* character
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Health equipment for sleeping
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the character you're playing
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the character you're pkilling
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Knowledge of the areas of the world
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Unmodified stats, i.e. stat scores without equipment
		</font></p>

	</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">
	In general, the longer you've been playing the more likely you are to meet
	these. You don't need all of them to be a good pkiller, and just because you
	have all of them doesn't mean you will be a good pkiller. In general though,
	meeting the above is a good place to start if you want to play with the big boys :)

<hr><a name="3"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[12.3]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Golden Rules</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">

</font></p><ol><font color="#000000">
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Preperation is everything
		</font></p>

	</li>
	<li>

		<p><font color="#000000">
			Never give a sucker an even break
		</font></p>

	</li>
</font></ol><font color="#000000">
</font><p></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The first rule is pretty clear -- if you're not prepared for the fight but
	your opponent is then its likely that you won't win. If you're both prepared,
	the two classes involved and luck are going to be large factors determining who
	wins. Preparation is everything from knowing what attack you'll start with, to
	knowing when to run if it all turns to custard :)
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The second rule needs a little more explaining. It means making the most of
	your strengths and never -- ever -- give your opponent a chance to use theirs.
	If you've got a big damage opening attack its best used when your opponent is
	injured and without a sanc' -- no point in trying to jump them when they are
	waiting for you! By all means attack a sanc'ed hero warrior but don't come
	running to me when you get sliced and diced into little pieces! Your victim's
	big opening attack is no use to them if you attack first, and their dangerous
	skills or spells aren't much good while you're lagging them with headbutt or
	blinding them with dirt kick. Opponent distracted by the mobs she's fighting?
	That's handy, she won't do much damage to you while donging a mob. So in
	summary, stack the deck so you're holding all the aces and hope they haven't
	slipped in a few jokers...
</font></p>
<hr><a name="4"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[12.4]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Hunting and Survival</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The trick to hunting people down is to know where they are leveling and to
	catch them in the middle of a leveling run. At most levels there are common
	places to level where the XP is high and plentiful; these are good places to
	look for people. A few of the recalls will help you cover a lot of ground pretty
	quickly. Once you've found where they are leveling, do all your preperation
	outside the area so if they are using <font color="#009933"><strong>WHERE</strong></font> they won't spot you coming
	and run (or prepare!). Then get to them as quickly as possible and beat the crap
	out of them, or fry them with a few spells should you be a less physical (i.e.
	more stylish) class :)
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	The trick to survival is pretty much to be where your hunter isn't expecting
	you to be. This means levelling away from the common areas and taking sensible
	precautions, like closing (and locking) doors behind you, minimising the time
	spent getting to the area when lurkers can see you, and using the <font color="#009933"><strong>WHERE</strong></font>
	command. A good healthy dose of paranoia is also essiential: everyone in other
	clans IS out to get you and it IS a conspiracy :)
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	At the time of writing this there are at least 4 "hard core" pkillers and a
	number of others who will be happy to take the time out to kill you; learning to
	avoid them or lure them out to have a go is a better long term strategy than
	waiting for them to leave -- these people have no lives you can't hide forever!
	Never leaving safety is a perfectly acceptable option but at some stage you'll
	have to level. You never can be sure that there are no killers on just because
	who target isn't showing anyone right now. Also "Midgaarditis" or
	hiding-in-safety is only a short term solution; until you learn to avoid
	pkillers while getting XP, your life in a clan will quickly become very
	frustrating. Thats not to say that you shouldn't hide -- hell no -- especially
	if you've spotted someone or escaped, but if your only defense is hiding then
	unless you have a lot of time clanned life will quickly become a very
	frustrating existence.

<hr><a name="5"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[12.5]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Safety</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Know when you are in safety -- put the <strong>%s</strong> (or <strong>%S</strong>) token in your
	prompt. No not later -- now!! Some areas have handy safe squares you can head
	for in an emergency, and areas you might think are safe might not be...
</font></p>
<hr><a name="6"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[12.6]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Pkill Characters: A special note</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Yes, people do create pkill characters, and yes, they will lurk at a certain
	level with no intention of levelling. Some class/race combinations have an edge
	at some levels and that's inevitable under the pre-requisite skill system. These
	characters aren't invincible although you'll really want to make sure you
	prepare the best you can if you go up against them. A lot of them rely on
	opening attacks or lagging attacks to keep you in the fight: if you can negate
	these then there is no reason you can't beat them. My advice is to work the
	system don't fight it.
</font></p>
<hr><a name="7"></a><p><font face="Tahoma, Ariel, Helvetica" color="#000099" size="3">[12.7]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Fair Fights</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">
	Fair -- what is fair? Everyone has their own definition of "fair", play to
	*yours* and accept everyone else's even if you don't like it. You can't change
	other people, and to a lot of pkillers complaints of an "unfair" kill after the
	fight is simply music to their ears... You'll also get a lot of satisfaction in
	taking out a player who you consider to be an "unfair" pkiller -- wait for the
	day as revenge is sweet!
