the megalodon~
A {Wgigantic shark{x swims here, on the lookout for prey.
~
You are face to face with one of the largest and most powerful predators to
have ever lived; he must be 20 metres long!  His jaws are full of gigantic
serrated teeth, and open wide enough for a full-grown man to walk around
inside them. Best hope he's not hungry.

The cuttlefish is a cephalopod similar in appearance to an octopus or
squid, with a flattened body bordered by a pair of narrow, undulating
fins it uses to manoeuvre.  It's covered in millions of chromatophores,
which let it blend in with its surroundings.

This one is unusually large and has a somewhat fearsome demeanour, but
doesn't appear to be too bothered by your presence, as it has decided
you're unlikely to make a good meal.

The ink sac is a muscular bag which originated as an extension of the
hind gut; it is a modified hypobranchial gland.  It lies beneath the
gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents � almost pure
melanin � can be squirted; its proximity to the base of the funnel
means that the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod
uses its jet propulsion. The ejected cloud of melanin is bound by mucus
particles, so it forms a lump approximately the size and shape of the
cephalopod, fixing the predator's attention while the mollusc itself
makes a hasty escape.  GROSS.~

looks like a giant wagon-wheel, with 6 large segments resembling negative space
around the wheel's "spokes" containing three banded rings of  buildings
perpendicular to them.  The sections with buildings in them are connected to
each other by bridges.

Outside the city are the dark outlines of irregularly-shaped islands.  Curious.

The amulet glows unnaturally, and carries the distinct feeling of magic about it.

"From Elb'kl Ala, Prince of Ota'ar Dar, to Klaabu of the Midgaard Morkoth.

While our uneasy truce with the cursed Alu'Tel'Quessir holds, we continue to
utilise any and all backchannels to seek our advantage, desiring most to drive
them from our realm forever and to reclaim the lands of ours they now occupy.

I therefore send you this letter in the hands of one of my most trusted emissaries
in the hope that he might convince you to meet with me and my barons, seeking an
alliance to our mutual benefit and the setting aside of old scores in the face of
a common enemy.

Send my emissary back, unharmed, with news of your decision.

{YAn Underwater Cave{x~
{yYou are in a dark, rocky underwater cavern that travels north and east.
Curiously, a pale blue light issuing from deeper within the cavern means
that you are not in total darkness, and can make out the surface of its
rocky walls, covered in deep-sea marine life.

To the north, the cavern lets out into the open sea, while east seems to
lead to a larger, more open cave chamber.{x
