<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. Omu has
been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

While Omu's crude wooden palisade blocks further travel south and west, you can
explore the city to the north and east, or swim up, towards a huge, looming area
of darkness above your head. The mud at your feet looks to have been recently
disturbed.

been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative

While Omu's rope bridge network blocks travel up, and the grung dwelling to your

<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. Omu has
been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

You can explore the city to the north, south, west and east of this location,
though the city's rope bridge network prevents travel up from here. A large,
rusty grill has been set into the sea floor near your feet. You can see it opens
into a huge, dark pit that has been carved out of the bedrock.

large, hollowed-out tree, but is constructed from coral, ancient stone,

with a hard, mud-like substance. This dwelling has been converted into the Omu

most of the buildings in the city.  There is a large <130>SIGN<137> written in Common on

de
<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. Omu has
been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

While Omu's rope bridge network blocks travel up, the grung dwelling to your
north has an entrance you can access from here, and you can still explore the
city to the east and south of this location.

slight earthy scent mixed with the briny tang of the sea.

The space is sparse, with a few rudimentary furnishings fashioned from coral,
driftwood, and scavenged materials. These pieces are functional, if primitive,
and blend seamlessly with the natural environment.

The main way in or out of the home is through a small, round hatch in the

bustling city of Omu above. A small hole in the east wall looks like it would be
a tight fit, but you can probably squeeze into it.<0>

caste-based, with the grung's colour denoting his role.  Green grung, such as
this individual, are warriors, hunters, and labourers.  This one looks a little
lost, as if trying to recall something he's just forgotten.

Grung are a race of small, froglike humanoids.  They are fiercely territorial,
and see themselves as superior to all other creatures.  Their society is
caste-based, with the grung's colour denoting his role.  Red grung, such as
this individual, are the scholars and magic-users of the grung race. This grung
is also a juvenile, not yet ready to take his place amongst the adults in grung
society.
