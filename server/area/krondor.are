1 STABLEMASTER~
If you are reading this then you have either met or are planning to meet
Kennan the Stablemaster located in Krondor.
He has the most desired mounts to offer all you have to do is ask him the
price?  All the horses are very obedient and if you tell them to stay they
will lie down and sleep to rest as well but you have to dismount them to do
that.   syntax :- say 'stallion stay' if you have a stallion and so forth.
Everything else will be revealed to you.

nidhogg dragon~
Nidhogg the dragon~
Nidhogg, a captured dragon, growls at your approach.
~
The dragon appears to be the city's attempt at waste disposal.  Several
piles of garbage smolder around him.  The whole arrangement appears safe
since the dragon is both muzzled and several huge chains are used to bind
him firmly to the ground.  Nidhogg gnaws on the chains in a vain attempt
to escape.

You stand in the midst of a gigantic stone archway. The two steel gates
look indestructible, yet they are elaborate in engravings.  The faint
stench of carrion blows in from the east.  Obviously, the city is the
only oasis of civilization in the rift. There is a small gold plaque on

You are at the poor alley.  South of here is the Crown & Anchor and to
the east you see common square.  North of here is an abandoned shop.  A
note is nailed to the shop's door.   The alley continues further west.
You're really confused and think you hear someone's insane laughter in
the distance.

KRONDOR
Extensive modifications made by Pinto on 5 May 1995. Area released on 20
August 1995.

This area is recommended for levels 35 through 50. Anyone below this level
is definitely encouraged NOT to enter the area. Level 35 will experience
some difficulty.

Within the area, certain sections are designated as player killing. This
section will expand as more areas are attached. There are NO RULES in the
player killing area. Immortals do not care what happens in these zones.

However, if you steal, you will still receive a flag. This technicality
will be removed sometime in the future. So, for now, the rule still
applies about no stealing anywhere on the mud.
~
E
large tome~
You open the tome and read a flip through a few pages...

"After my banishment from Midgaard, I fled from that plane through the
void into a nearby plane.  After studying the void, I have derived its
secrets and have created a permanent rift connecting the two worlds.
Hopefully this will aid me in my plans of re-entering the world of
Midgaard.

During my studies of the void, I discovered its inhabitants.  At first I
thought there existed none within this chaos, but there are and have
proven to be extremely difficult to control.  Fortunately, the rift I
created will protect any traveller from them. Communication with the
inhabitants of the void is nearly impossible.  I only know that they call
the void Ginnungagap.

After arriving on this other world, I discovered the kingdom of Krondor.
I have only explored the city and surrounding areas.  The entire land
appears to be extremely hostile.  However for the adventurous, the rewards
are great.  The citizens of the city appear to be friendly albeit
barbaric. However I detect with a few some hidden malice towards me.
I especially mistrust any member of Krondor's clergy.  I believe they are
involved with the Ginnungagap and may have discovered my secret.  I may
soon have to deal with them."

You discover it's a long, drawn-out diary and toss it back to the corpse.

the constant run off of water.  You lose your footing and slip down the

     You tumble down the ramp and fall through the air into a pool of
water.  It appears the room was solely designed to collect rain water
during times of drought.  Several openings line the ceiling to supply the

The Ancient Portal~
You open the hidden entrance to the altar and head along a short tunnel.
You emerge into a small chamber, basked in deep blue light.  Just before
the northern wall, a large oval disk of intense blue light crackles and
sparks: it is a magical portal.
