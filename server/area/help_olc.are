                     by:  Kahn, Kith, Hatchet and The EnvyMud Staff

    Diku Mud was created by Hans Henrik St{rfeldt, Katja Nyboe,
      Tom Madsen, Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer.

    Based on the original Merc 2.2 source.      Kahn, Hatchet, Furey

50 IMOTD~
This is the immortal motd.

~

-1 SCHOOL~
Mud School was designed by Hatchet of MERC Industries for any MERC mud.

The purpose of Mud School is to orient new players to the basics of the
game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.

Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their
initial levels and equipment.

You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.

You may train your attributes and make them better at the Adept of Furey
one 'NORTH' and one 'WEST' of the Entrance of Mud School.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.

There is also a practice adept one 'NORTH' and one 'EAST' of the Entrance of
Mud School.  You may not practice until your character reaches 3rd level
however.  See 'HELP PRACTICE'.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.

LIST with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
LIST <object> lists only the items corresponding with <object> the shop
keeper will sell you.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

BUY, SELL, and VALUE, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if LIST DAGGER showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:
"buy 3.dagger".
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have AUTOEXIT set, you
will automatically see the visible exits whenever you walk into a room.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type "drop all.pie".
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your visible inventory.
~

0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KICK KILL MURDER~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions on
murdering low level players, and there are penalties for using MURDER.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice the
appropriate skill.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: read    <keyword>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all         command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and
they will no longer follow your orders.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: wake  <character>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

~

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

    miss        wound           MUTILATE        DEMOLISH
    scratch     maul            DISEMBOWEL      ANNIHILATE
    graze       decimate        EVISCERATE
    hit         devastate       MASSACRE
    injure      maim
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated in purgatory.  Your corpse is
taken by the Death Reaper and protected from scavengers.  You must find your
way through Purgatory to your corpse in order to reclaim your possessions.
Miraculously, however, your gold stays with you, so apparently you CAN take
it with you.

Any spells which were affecting you, good and bad, are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half-way back to
the beginning of your level.  Thus if you have a bad day and die several times,
the penalties won't clobber you.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

-1 STORY~
One hundred and fifty years ago ...

Nomads from the Great Eastern desert brought spices and slaves to the Thalos
Market.  Dwarven miners, rough and rude, sold precious stones and drank the
town dry of firebreathers.  Stone golems, created by mages from the Tower of
High Sorcery, stood sentry duty in the watch towers.

It was dawn on the Day of Thunder.  The Mayor of Midgaard (great-grand-father
of today's Mayor) arrived early to pay tribute at City Hall.  He entered the
Grand Gate unchallenged.  He found the streets and markets empty.  Seeing a
nearby lamia, he asked her about the residents.  Where were all the people?

The lamia didn't act like a lamia.  Instead of answering him in the helpful but
stupid lamia manner, she stabbed the Mayor with a long, slim dagger.  Other
lamias, hearing the tumult, arrived and attacked.  The Mayor was killed.

Now Thalos is abandoned.  Wild lamias roam the streets, killing intruders and
sacrificing their bodies at the Temple of Thalos.  The golems no longer respond
to command and now watch eternally from their ruined towers.

Midgaard is next.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet.
~

0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug  <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, as well as
a comparison of your relative health.  Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

0 CREDITS~
Syntax: credits

        All of these immortals have contributed in some way to the
workings of this mud.  Please treat them with respect and dignity for
they _SHAPE YOUR MUD FUTURE!_
        Apprenticed Immortals have not been officially added to this
list for they currently do not belong to any group.  At the time they
officially send in improvements to this mud, they will be named with
their peers.
        Congratulations to all here and keep up the good work!

0 AUTO CONFIG~
Syntax: auto
Syntax: config
Syntax: config +<option>
Syntax: config -<option>

AUTO shows the status of some of your character behavior options.

~

0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <string>

advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 AUCTION CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: auction  <message>

Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~

0 EMOTE , POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

POSE is a variant of EMOTE.
~

0 NOTE~
Syntax: note list
Syntax: note read
Syntax: note read    <number>

means all immortals.  Use NOTE + to write message lines onto the note, one line
at a time.  NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST or NOTE SEND posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.

Also see BASH for warriors.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your God.  God may reward you for the sacrifice.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.

Hint: God likes corpses.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, than fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 BASH 'BASH DOOR'~
Syntax: bash <direction>

A powerful warrior can attempt to bypass the intricacies of unlocking
and opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course,
tends to make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.
Be aware, however, that bashing is a fairly aggressive action, and
some mobs don't take kindly to that type of behavior...
~

0 CHAMELEON 'CHAMELEON POWER'~
Syntax: chameleon

With CHAMELEON POWER, a psionicist uses the power of his or her mind to change
the appearance and coloration of his or her body, armor, and equipment to
blend in with the surroundings.  This skill is only effective if the
psionicist remains absolutely still.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 HEIGHTEN 'HEIGHTEN SENSES'~
Syntax: heighten

A psionicist is able to HEIGHTEN SENSES to detect things that would otherwise
go unnoticed.
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: HIDE
Syntax: SNEAK
Syntax: VISIBLE

If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.

If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without
being noticed.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 'POISON WEAPON'~
Syntax: poison <weapon>

With this skill, a thief can create a deadly poison that can be poured
onto any weapon, rendering it more deadly.  This skill is not easy,
however, because the poison itself requires special ingredients, and the
thief must be steady of hand and clear of mind.  The profit-minded thief
(is there any other kind?) might even think about selling the products
of his or her labor to other adventurers for a tidy profit.

Be Warned!  The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon
in due time.  Special blades may be more resistant to the poison effects
on the steel.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a GUILDMASTER to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, may not be
saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to
the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse will not recall at all.
~

0 SHADOW 'SHADOW FORM'~
Syntax: shadow

A psionicist can use his or her mind power to blend in with the shadows while
moving, having the same effect as the thief skill SNEAK.  See also VISIBLE.
~

0 SPELLS~
Syntax: spells

This command shows the spell caster how much mana each spell he or she knows
will cost.

For a list of ALL available spells for your class, type SLIST.
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins    <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'hp'|'mana'|'move'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard atttributes based on your class, and several
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

You may also train your hitpoints, mana points, and movement points.  Each
of these costs one practice session and gives a somewhat unpredictable gain.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

54 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

54 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

53 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.
~

52 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK NEWLOCK NUMLOCK~
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown
Syntax: wizlock
Syntax: numlock <number>
Syntax: newlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level immortal without a special bit set may not log in.  Players who
lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NUMLOCK shows at which character level and below may not log in.

NUMLOCK <number> sets which character level and below MAY NOT log in.
Players level immortal and above with a special bit set MAY log in.
Players who lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NEWLOCK is a shortcut to NUMLOCK 1.  NEWLOCK will turn on numlock but
not turn off if currently set.
~

53 DENY DISCONNECT FREEZE~
Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>
Syntax: freeze     <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within the
game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal a
DENY by editing the appropriate player file.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

53 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

52 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.

SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

52 MSET OSET RSET SSET~
Syntax: mset <character> <field> <value>
Syntax: oset <object>    <field> <value>
Syntax: rset <location>  <field> <value>
Syntax: sset <character> <skill> <value>
Syntax: sset <character> all     <value>

MSET, OSET, and RSET set the properties of mobiles, objects, and rooms,
respectively.  SSET sets a skill or spell level on a PC.  Do NOT sset
all on an immortal (including yourself) or that person will immediately
lose all immortal abilities.

There is currently no way to enter more than one line of text for a
string-valued option.  In this case, MSET <character> description is
not supported.
~

53 NOEMOTE NOTELL SILENCE~
Syntax: noemote <character>
Syntax: notell  <character>
Syntax: silence <character>

NOEMOTE, NOTELL, and SILENCE are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, telling, and using channels, respectively.
Characters who are no'telled will also not receive those forms of
communication.
~

52 MLOAD OLOAD~
Syntax: mload <vnum>
Syntax: oload <vnum>

MLOAD loads a mobile given its vnum (virtual number).  The vnum's are just
the #NNNN numbers that appear in world.obj.

OLOAD loads an object given its vnum.
~

53 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
Syntax: pardon <character> thief

PARDON pardons a player for their crimes.
~

53 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
Syntax: purge <character>

PURGE is used to clean up the world.  PURGE with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  PURGE with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

PURGE will not get rid of PC's.
~

53 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>

RESTORE restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.
~

54 SSTIME~
Syntax: sstime
Syntax: sstime <field> <value>

Syntax: transfer all         <location>

TRANSFER transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location.
~

53 USERS~
Syntax: users

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the channel
number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in merc.h:
0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.
~

53 WIZIFY~
Syntax: wizify <character>

WIZIFY toggles the wizbit flag of a character.  This enables the wizified
character to enter the game despite a WIZLOCK.
~

indicating who sent it.
~

52 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

MEMORY reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

52 MFIND OFIND~

~

52 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

PEACE causes all characters and mobiles in a room to stop fighting.
~

52 SLOOKUP~
Syntax: slookup <skill-or-spell>
Syntax: slookup all

SLOOKUP shows you the internal 'sn' and external 'slot' for the given skill
or spell.  The 'sn' is used for OSET and OSTAT.  The 'slot' is used for area
files.  Neither 'sn' nor 'slot' is used for player files; these operate with
the actual skill and spell names.

SLOOKUP ALL shows this information for all skills and spells.
~

52 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
Syntax: return

SWITCH switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC).

RETURN returns you to your original body.
~

51 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).  Thus, AT will not work to private locations.
~

51 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin
Syntax: bamfin  <message>
Syntax: bamfout
Syntax: bamfout <message>

The standard messages for GOTO are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and

these reset the messages to their defaults.
~

51 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.
~

51 HOLYLIGHT WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: wizinvis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

WIZINVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player
characters of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal WIZINVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

50 IMMTALK :~

~

0 TRAINER~
TRAINERs can provide extensive training sessions which enable players
to TRAIN their base statistics.
~

-1 WAR WARRIOR~
The WARRIOR class is the most basic fighting class available.  Their
battle training along with high strength and high hit points make them
very formidable in hand to hand combat.  WARRIORs train in the art of
multiple attacks.  Some master the art of a SECOND ATTACK and if experienced
enough, master a THIRD ATTACK.  Along with this training in multiple
attacks, a WARRIOR is trained in making each hit count.  ENHANCED DAMAGE
is available to only the learned.  Toward the defense side of the WARRIOR,
skills of PARRY, RESCUE and BASH DOOR allow the WARRIOR to ward off attacks,
rush to the aid of fellow comrades, and open doors rather barbarically.
~

-1 CLE CLERIC~
The CLERIC class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward
defense.  A deity gives the CLERIC spells in the curing, warding, and
protection divinities.  CLERICs being of a defensive nature fare poorly
in the art of mortal combat.  They much prefer to be civil servants to
society or doctors to their comrades in arms.
~

-1 MAG MAGE MAGIC MAGIC-USER 'MAGIC USER'~
The MAGE class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward control
over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power the MAGE taps
into to influence the world.  MAGE spells are devoted to the invoking,
hermetic, and combative nature.  MAGEs fare a little better than their
CLERIC counterparts in hand-to-hand combat though they much prefer to
stand back and roast their enemies with a FIREBALL.
~

-1 THI THIEF~
The THIEF class can be characterized as a WARRIOR who dropped out of school
to pursue more "profitable" means of living.  These wirey persons have
physical endurance slightly less than that of a WARRIOR but are much more
agile.  Whereas a WARRIOR uses well placed weapon slashes, a THIEF seeks to
DISARM his opponent.  THIEVES also excel in the art of stealth.
An unwary opponent might not detect a THIEF until a BACKSTAB is attempted.
To achieve success in this, the skills SNEAK and HIDE are learned.  With
a THIEF's PICK LOCK and POISON WEAPON skill, a THIEF also makes the perfect
assassin for political powerhouses.
~

-1 PSI PSIONICS PSIONICIST~
The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
~

0 GHOST~
When traveling in the night, beware of GHOSTS.  Fortunately, sunlight is
a bane for these representatives of the dead.
~

0 'ADRENALINE CONTROL'~
Syntax: cast 'adrenaline control'

By controlling the production and release of adrenaline in his or her system,
the psionicist can gain temporary boosts in dexterity and constitution.  This
control cannot be initiated during battle because, hey, even psionicists get a
little excited from time to time.
~

0 AGITATION~
Syntax: cast 'agitation' <character>

This skill is nearly identical to the Mage spell BURNING HANDS.  With this
skill, a psionicist can cause the cells in his or her victim to become
agitated, moving so fast as to cause burn damage.
~

0 AWE~
Syntax: cast 'awe' <character>

With this discipline, a skilled psionicist can use the power of his or
her mind to affect the morale of an opponent.  If successful, the enemy
will be overcome by awe for the psionicist, and will simply forget to
fight.  Of course, aggressive monsters will revert to their true nature
after only a brief lull in the action.
~

0 'BALLISTIC ATTACK'~
Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' <character>

BALLISTIC ATTACK lets a psionicist use the powers of his or her mind to throw
small objects, usually a rock or other debris that happens to be in the area,
at the target.  The results can be rather amusing to the psionicist, and
painful to the victim.
~

0 'BIOFEEDBACK'~
Syntax: cast 'biofeedback'

BIOFEEDBACK is the power with which a psionicist controls the flow of blood
through his or her body.  This control allows the psionicist to reduce
bleeding, as well as cushion blows against him or her, effectively reducing
the damage by half.  Mind over body indeed...
~

0 'CELL ADJUSTMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'cell adjustment'

A skilled psionicist can also perform CELL ADJUSTMENT, which can remove both
curses and poisons from his or her body.
~

0 'COMBAT MIND'~
Syntax: cast 'combat mind'

A psionicist using COMBAT MIND has a very keen understanding of his or her
enemies and their fighting tactics.  As a result, the psionicist has an
increased chance of hitting his or her enemies, and knows how to minimize the
damage received from their blows.  Because psionicists are telepathinc, this
knowledge can also be shared with the his or her companions.
~

0 'CONTROL FLAMES'~
Syntax: cast 'control flames' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can will the flames in his or her light source to
leap out and strike an enemy.  And if you don't think your light source uses a
flame, well, you're wrong.  You just aren't looking close enough.
~

0 'DEATH FIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'death field'

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionicists
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor
damage.
~

0 'DETONATE'  'DISINTEGRATE'~
Syntax: cast 'detonate'     <character>
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <character>

With both of these skills, a psionocist uses his or her mind to affect the
latent energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough to
the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason, most
psionocists choose the victim itself as the target, since there's bound to be
SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.  Mid-level psionicists can DETONATE
objects on their victim, and extremely skilled psionicists can even
DISINTEGRATE their victims, killing them instantly.
~

0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' 'DISPLACEMENT' 'FLESH ARMOR'
  'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'
Syntax: cast 'displacement'
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in place
by the psionicist's will.

DISPLACEMENT makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her actual
position, thus making him or her more difficult to hit.

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an
armor-like substance.

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

INERTIAL BARRIER creates a barrier of positive energy that reduces the damage
infliced by creatures of negative energy.
~

0 'DOMINATION'~
Syntax: cast 'domination' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can DOMINATE the mind of his or her intended
victim, causing the victim to do exactly as the psionicist says.  As with
CHARM, the actions of dominated characters affect the status of the dominator;
don't whine if you get a KILLER flag.
~

0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <character>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
~

0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~

0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' <object>

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects,
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot
rearrange its molecules.
~

0 'MIND THRUST' 'INFLICT PAIN' 'PSYCHIC CRUSH' 'PSIONIC BLAST' 'ULTRABLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust'   <character>
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <character>
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <character>
Syntax: cast 'ultrablast'    <character>

With these skills, a psionicist can telepathically cause damage to the neural
synapses of his or her victim.  The devotions are listed in increasing order of
damage inflicted.
~

0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <character>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or her own
expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~

0 'PROJECT FORCE'~
Syntax: cast 'project force' <character>

If a psionicist successfully PROJECTS FORCE, the force of his or her mind will
strike against the victim's body, causing moderate damage.
~

0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <character>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~

0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist
does not become too weak.
