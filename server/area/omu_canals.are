a hideous sea hag~
<63>A hideous sea hag is searching for victims to eat.<0>
~
The hideous sea hag patrols the waters, her presence a warning to all who
venture so deep. With skin as rough as barnacles and eyes that gleam with malice,
she moves with purpose, searching for victims. Her rank, matted hair flows like
dead seaweed in the current, and her gnarled hands clutch at the empty space
before her, ready to clutch, stab, and strangle.

~
A smallish, paunchy humanoid male with the head of a fish and slender, webbed
hands and feet, this Kua-toa is frowning at you, obviously suspicious.  Kua-toa
are notoriously duplicitous, willing to turn on anyone if they suspect it will
be to their advantage, or simply out of peer pressure or fear of maltreatment.

He looks well-equipped for combat, no doubt expecting to find trouble in these
underwater canals.

Ixzan are similar in appearance to manta rays, but dusky in appearance, fanged,
sentient, and live only in the darkest and deepest waters.  They tend to avoid
conflict with humanoids, but are more than ready to defend themselves if attack.
This looks like an ixzan of the rare 'vampiric' subtype.

Uchuulons resembled ordinary chuuls in size and shape: a hideous combination of
crustacean, insect, and serpent some 8 ft long and weighing approximately 290 kg,
with a mass of tentacles in front of the mouth, two large claws, and a fanned
tail. They differ in that their carapace is softer, translucent, and coated in a
thick mucus.

Ambush predators, they tend to hide in mud and darkness and lunge at their prey
when the opportunity arises.

Omu / Yrythelmyn Northern Bridge, Upper~
<21>You float about 4 metres above the western end of the northern bridge connecting
<27>Omu's central area to Yrythelmyn.  The upper portion of Yythelmyn's gleaming,
<33>majestic gates lie to the west, while the corresponding portions of Omu's crude
<39>hardwood gates can be seen in the distance to the east. To the north and south
<45>you may venture into the deep canal system which separates Omu and Yrythelmyn
from each other, you may travel downwards, towards the ocean floor, or you can swim
upwards, directly into the huge, looming area of dark water above your head.

A large <21>SIGN<45> has been fastened to Yrythelmyn's locked and barred gates.<0>
