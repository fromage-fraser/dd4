gladiator kaer'l kaerl~
a Kaer'l gladiator~
A Kaer'l gladiator stalks about purposefully, sword in hand.
~
Heavily armed for a sahuagin gladiator, a Kaer'l fighter is equipped with
sword, shield, belt, pauldrons, helmet, and shin guards. Usually tall and
muscular to bear the weight of their equipment, Kaer'ls depend on their
strength and endurance to survive combat against foes better suited to
the attack.  Their shields give them an edge in defence, and their short
swords can thrust and swing at enemies in short range.  They are also
trained to kick opponents, protected by the thick padding and shin guards
they wear.

a Luv'ht gladiator~
A Luv'ht gladiator bristles at your observation.
~
Lightly armoured and heavily armed, a Luv'ht fighter dual wields short swords,
but is protected only by a belt or a loincloth. Preferring close-combat
fighting, Luv'ht tend to be the most skilled and experienced of gladiators,
and by far the most popular with the crowds of sahuagin who come to the arena
to watch them ply their bloody trade.

gladiator Maland~
a Maland gladiator~
A Maland gladiator rattles his spear and small buckler at you.
~
The Maland gladiator is armed with a small buckler and a spear, making him
quite competent at middle-distance combat.  The buckler is as useful for
offense as defense, often being used to ram and smash his opponent in his
charges, and to discourage fighters trying to close range on him.  Usually
he is matched against Kaer'l, as their strengths and weaknesses line up
well to create interesting matches.

gladiator Heiral~
a Heiral gladiator~
A Heiral gladiator grasps his trident and net menacingly.
~
The Heiral gladiator's arms are (apparently humorously) styled on those of a
human fisherman.  He carries a weighted net for entangling his opponents, and
a sharp trident for finishing them off once they are so entangled. having
nearly no armour, he is reliant on using his speed and agility to avoid his
opponent's attacks and wait for the perfect opportunity to strike.

an Urm'da gladiator~
An Urm'da gladiator gestures at you terribly with his bladed hand.
~
The Urm'da gladiator fights with one hand encased in a hardened metal tube
that has the "hand" end capped off with a semicircular blade.  This blade
can be used both to tear away his opponents' shields and block their blows
and to quick counterattack with either the bladed end, or the short sword
he carries in his other hand.

It resembles a bizarre eel, with a long, tubular body, a tail at one end, two
fins near the head, and another along the back. Its mouth is lamprey-like, and
filled with serrated, jawless teeth. You feel afraid just being in its presence,
and have a strong intuition that it might be best to leave it alone.

a laghathti~
<21>A spherical mass of writhing tentacles radiates pure evil.<0>
~
This is a laghathti,a kind of cephalopodan obyrith demon.  It has a loose
resemblance to octopuses, but that comparison in no way captures its alien
appearance. For one, it seemingly has no core; what passes for a body is
really just a spherical mass of writhing tendrils, roughly 8 feet in diameter.
Aside from that, its form consists of twelve, midnight-blue tentacles. Five
of them have a pale underside riddled with hundreds of tiny mouths, another
five are slimmer and ended in wide, paddle-like fins, and the other two are
shorter, stronger, and end in long, crocodilian jaws from which the creature's
high-pitched wails emanate.

giant gar alligator~
a giant gar~
<65>A massive, sleek alligator gar circles her cage frantically.<0>
~
The body of this alligator gar is torpedo-shaped and olive in colour (fading
to a lighter gray on the ventral surface). Her scales are ganoid, which are
bone-like, rhomboidal-shaped scales with serrated edges, which are covered
by an enamel-like substance making them nearly impenetrable and excellent
protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of an
alligator gar like this has a dual row of large, sharp teeth that are used
to impale and hold prey. This is a stalking, ambush predator, primarily
a piscivore, but they also prepared to ambush and eat waterfowl and small
mammals found floating on the water's surface.

Sekolic Nuncio~
a Sekolic Nuncio~
A Sekolic Nuncio stands here, eyes closed and concentrating hard.
~
The Sekolic Nuncio is a diplomatic envoy from the temple of Sekolah.  His job
here is to create and maintain the magical field around the arena that prevents
combatants from leaving it (save with the permission of the local baron), and
spectators from getting overly-excited and storming the arena.  It also
prevents escape of the combatants upwards, into the Shadowsea.

While the field can largely be maintained without his active involvement (and
would continue to exist even if he were to die, at least for a while) the
stress that is constantly put on it by the spectators and combatants means he
does have to do a fair amount of regular arcane 'maintenance'.

Ota'ar Dar Arena Floor, Lower~
<190>You are standing on the floor of a vast undersea arena, of the sort built
for the enjoyment of hideous spectacles of violence and carnage. Huge tiers of
seating lie to the north and south. Invisible barriers of force (presumably
magical) prevent your exit north into the seated areas, and a high wall
prevents any movement east.  You can move south, west, or directly up from your
current location.<0>

{gYou are in the upper tier of spectator seating in the southern part of the
Ota'ar Dar arena.  The arena lies to your immediate west, though there seems
to be some peculiar invisible force that stops you from proceeding far in
that direction. A high wall rises to your north, preventing travel in that
direction also.

From here you can wander through the upper seating area to the south, head to
the arena's antechamber to the east, head downwards to the lower seating tier,
or swim directly up, into the huge, looming area of dark water above you.{x

to the cubiculum lies just down from here.
