In what is a very unusual sight in Ota'ar Dar, Mohmit is a human mage from the
Great Eastern Desert who has made his home and livelihood here.  While many
sahuagin grudgingly accept the use of magic and magical goods, they generally
will at best view them as a necessary evil, and for a sahuagin to directly
trade in such goods would be regarded as scandalous.  So it is that Mohmit saw
an opportunity and seized it.

He is a swarthy-skinned, reasonably cheerful, somewhat rotund, and rather
short gentleman, who is eager to sell you his wares.  Perhaps a little TOO
eager, as he talks to you incessantly as you browse the shelves in the shop.

A pearl is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue
(specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or other similar animal.
Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate
(mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline
form, which has deposited in concentric layers. The ideal pearl is perfectly
round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur.
The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and
objects of beauty for many centuries. This one is large and perfectly spherical.

A good way to silence a person and send a strong message at the same time,
the tongue tearer is a torture device often used to silence people who commit
blasphemy or heresy. The victim's mouth is forced open, then the tongue tearer
is clamped onto the victim's tongue; the screw at its back is tightened to
make sure the grip on the tongue is firm. The torturer then yanks the tongue
out of the victim's head with all his might, silencing the victim (hopefully)
for good.

The instep borer was is an instrument of torture that externally resembles
an iron boot. It is hinged to permit the free insertion and removal of a bare
foot. A crank projects from a housing over the instep, which conceals a long,
thick, serrated iron blade, grooved so as to inflict maximum damage and
promote liberal blood flow. Turning the crank slowly advances the blade into
the boot, punching a hole through the center of the instep. The resulting
wound is so large that it is not unusual for its victim to die of toxaemia
soon after.

are lined up on wooden platforms while their owners stand nearby, making
exaggerated claims regarding their quality and abilities and haggling with
prospective buyers.

Torturers' Training Dungeon~
{gYou stand on the second storey of a ruined building, deep underwater. The
room has been converted to a torturer's dungeon, for the purposes of
demonstrating the goods that are sold in the shop below.  It is dank, grim,
and the walls are covered with various hideous-looking devices for the torture
of the hopeless and hapless.  The entire room gives you a foul feeling, as
though it has been cursed by dark magiks.

You may travel down from here to the main floor of the "Torturers' Delight"
shop, or swim directly up, into the huge, looming area of dark water above you.{x

paintings murals walls~
The decorations depict many blood sacrifices being made to Sekolah, and him
ignoring nearly all of them, scorning those weak enough to petition  him for
aid.  HThe paintings givethe impression that he will intervene in sahuagin
affairs to feast on his followers' enemies once their destruction already
seems assured, or to sate his bloodlust on gargantuan creatures of the sea
who may or may not pose a threat to his worshippers, with any benefit accruing
to them being a complete coincidence.~

quarter themselves, and is orderly and monastic in feel... for a sahuagin

From here you can swim west, out to the main Sekolah temple, upwards into the
huge, looming area of darkness in the water just above your head, or down to
Sekolah's Depths' main living and study area.{x

glyphs markings~
The glyphs and markings, as best you can tell, describe the magical creation
by the acolytes of a large, dark, cursed region of sea directly above Ota'ar
Dar, to keep the city safe from the depredations of surface-dwellers and their
other, sea-dwelling enemies. They also depict malevolent spirit entities being
summoned to populate and patrol the region.

You get the impression from the images that blood sacrifices are required to
maintain the magic, but it is unclear if sentient species must be killed for
this purpose.~
