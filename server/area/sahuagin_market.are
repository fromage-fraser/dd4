Mohmit stands here, ready to sell you magical supplies.

In what is a very unusual sight in Ota'ar Dar, Mohmit is a human mage from the
Great Eastern Desert who has made his home and livelihood here.  While many
sahuagin grudgingly accept the use of magic and magical goods, they generally
will at best view them as a necessary evil, and for a sahuagin to directly
trade in such goods would be regarded as scandalous.  So it is that Mohmit saw
an opportunity and seized it.

He is a swarthy, reasonably cheerful, somewhat rotund, and rather short
gentleman, who is eager to sell you his wares.  Perhaps a little TOO eager,
as he talks to you incessantly as you browse the shelves in the shop.

Reaver Ciy'yn is the Ota'ar Dar Reaver guildmaster.  He is a wiry,
grim-looking sahuagin, whose many raids and journeys of dangerous

impatiently awaits an explanation.

exponents, roots, logarithms, and trigonometry. It is not typically designed
for addition or subtraction, which is usually performed using other methods.

order of magnitude of results.  This one has seen better days.

A pearl is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue
(specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or other similar animal.
Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate
(mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline
form, which has deposited in concentric layers. The ideal pearl is perfectly
round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur.
The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and
objects of beauty for many centuries. This one is large and perfectly spherical.

A good way to silence a person and send a strong message at the same time,
the tongue tearer is a torture device often used to silence people who commit
blasphemy or heresy. The victim's mouth is forced open, then the tongue tearer
is clamped onto the victim's tongue; the screw at its back is tightened to
make sure the grip on the tongue is firm. The torturer then yanks the tongue
out of the victim's head with all his might, silencing the victim (hopefully)
for good.

The instep borer was is an instrument of torture that externally resembles
an iron boot. It is hinged to permit the free insertion and removal of a bare
foot. A crank projects from a housing over the instep, which conceals a long,
thick, serrated iron blade, grooved so as to inflict maximum damage and
promote liberal blood flow. Turning the crank slowly advances the blade into
the boot, punching a hole through the center of the instep. The resulting
wound is so large that it is not unusual for its victim to die of toxaemia
soon after.

Thrall.

You may imagine that by being abducted by the foul sahuagin and taken below
the ocean to suffer whatever trifling indiginities ending in your death and
dismemberment they might see fit to inflict upon your pathetic body that you
thereby will escape your service to me: your lord, master, and rightful owner.

Such an imagining is woefully misguided.

I hold prisoner every member of your worthless family, and will execute them
as slowly and painfully as it is possible to do so should you not return to my
service within the month. It is of no interest or consequence to me how you
manage this feat.

Return now or die tormented by the knowledge of their destruction.

Master.

It is as you imagine; I have been abducted by the cruel sahuagin, who plan to
kill me as a form of mass entertainment in their underwater arena. I have no
hope of escape, and have accepted my fate.

Having long anticipated your threat to my family should I ever be torn from
your service, however, I have made arrangements with a trusted party in one
of the Domain's cities to offer a very large bounty to the town's adventurers
should any unnatural harm ever come to my family; a bounty made up of the
wealth I have secreted from you over long years as you lay asleep during
the day.

I have provided him with details of your whereabouts and every method that
might be used to locate you, should you not remain in your current lair in
the Vale.

I would urge you strongly to consider this certain consequence should you
choose to harm my family.  You know how troublesome the Domain's adventurers
are, and how definite your destruction will be should you continue on your
asserted course.

Your faithful servant,


--Giuseppe

area of darkness in the water above. You notice, however, that the canton wall to
the west doesn't quite reach all the way to the dark region of water above.

"Mother's Ruin". Some sort of magic is in effect here that keeps the ocean's
water at bay, despite being so far below the sea's surface.

All around you you see evidence of the misery of the Domain's sentient
species, and the cruel joy of their unscrupulous captors.  Shackled slaves
are lined up on wooden platforms while their owners stand nearby, making
exaggerated claims regarding their quality and abilities and haggling with
prospective buyers.

You may exit west to Dae'as Street, swim up to the second level of the slave
market, or enter Ota'ar Dar's Brawlarium, to the east.{x

Mala't's Quarters~
{gYou stand in the quarters of Mala't the Sage, chief artefact identifier
of Ota'ar Dar, on the second storey of a ruined building, deep underwater.
The room is very comfortable-feeling and homely for a sahuagin dwelling,
you imagine Mala't must enjoy his 'creature' comforts.

You may travel down from here to the first floor of Mala't's home, or
directly up, into the huge, looming area of dark water above you.{x

Mohmit's Quarters~
{gYou stand in the quarters of Mohmit, magical goods supplier of Ota'ar Dar,
on the second storey of a ruined building, deep underwater.  The room is
tidy but full of curious-looking and doubtlessly magical objects; no doubt
the product of a lifetime's work in the magical goods trade.

You may travel down from here to the magical supplies shop, directly up,
into the huge, looming area of dark water above you, or east to the top
floor of Mohmit's magical laboratory.{x

Mohmit's Magical Laboratory, Upper~
{GYou stand inside the upper floor of a small two-storey building, deep under
the sea. This floor and the one below it have been converted into a
fully-functioning magical laboratory by their  owner, Mohmit.  This is where
he manufactures all the magical goods he sells in his shop.

You can travel west to Mohmit's living quarters, down to the first floor of
the laboratory, or directly up, into the huge, looming area of dark water
above you.{x

in the middle of the room. You probably shouldn't be here.{x

glyphs markings~
The glyphs and markings, as best you can tell, describe the magical creation
by the acolytes of a large, dark, cursed region of sea directly above Ota'ar
Dar, to keep the city safe from the depredations of surface-dwellers and their
other, sea-dwelling enemies. They also depict malevolent spirit entities being
summoned to populate and patrol the region.

You get the impression from the images that blood sacrifices are required to
maintain the magic, but it is unclear if sentient species must be killed for
this purpose.~

Gresnyk's Pipes and Smokeables~
{GMost peculiarly for an undersea merchant, Gresnyk sells pipes, smokeables, and
associated paraphernalia.  When asked how he can possibly stay in business
selling pipes (which obviously won't light underwater) in Ota'ar Dar, he
replies that there's a strong tourist trade, and anyway, sahuagin don't spend
ALL their time underwater.  He mentions if you want to try any of his
smokeables, you can go upstairs, to an "air" room he has had specially-created
for the purpose.

Form here you can exit the store west, to Sekolah Way, or head up to the second
floor of the building.{x

ruins of an ancient city.  Through the haze of smoking fumes that fill the room
you can make out that it contains many large cushions, a variety of hookah-style
pipes and a variety of bioluminescent "mood lighting". You may travel down
into his shop, or directly up, into the huge, looming area of dark water
above you.{x
