(An exerpt from a journal of an unknown adventurer)
Date Unknown
	... and after locating Horl the Knight and paying his bail, we finally
left Midgaard on the first day of the new moon, 3 days behind schedule.  Our
guide says that he knows the quickest way to Thalos, and that we can expect to
reach the ruins there by late tomorrow.   We left the east gate of Midgaard,
and travelled east for several hours until reaching a spot where several roads
cross.  We traveled south for another hour or two, then decided to pitch camp
for the night.  Once again, I, Gagglesneeze, the Greatest Mage to walk these
lands, am stuck with the midnight watch.  How I long for a group that realizes
the delicate rest required of a mage.

	Today, we continued south, until the woods thickened and we were forced
to turn east or west, or return north in failure.  Following our guide's
lead, we turned east and walked through the woods for several hours, turning
south at noon, and then preceding east again when we had skirted the clump of
thickets that had forced us out of our way.  We now stand at the top of a
valley, and are making camp here for the night.  Our guide assures us that
Thalos lies just over the far rim of the valley.  For once, I will get some
sleep, as I have convinced that fool priest Karl to take my watch for me.
Hopefully tomorrow morning we may begin amassing treasure in Thalos.

	Today did not bode well from the very beginning.  I awoke to a small
amount of yelling going on in camp.  It appeared our guide had left in the
middle of the night, taking some of Ravin the Burglar's gold and equipment with
him.  We decided to look for Thalos anyway.  It was nowhere to be found.
But the thief, Ravin, found a cave behind a fox hole down in the valley.  We
preceded into the cave, and came to a spot where we could only go down or
return the way we had came.  We rested before decending, and I had no more than
fallen asleep for a quick nap, when a dark creature that looked vaguely elvish
attacked me from out of nowhere.  The others quickly subdued him.  We then
decended into the hole below us, prepared for anything but what awaited us.
2 more of the creatures jumped out of hiding and attacked us.  Only Ravin's
finding a secret door below allowed us to escape.  We then went west, the
only direction left to us, and were set upon by a fantastically quick creature
wielding a glowing black longsword.  I was the only one able to flee the
fight alive.  Now I am hiding amongst some goblin slaves...all of my spells
exhausted.  I can hear the foot troops looking for me outside.  I don't know
how i will survive this...

An excerpt from a book recently acquired from the mages guild by the thief
Picard (to whom our condolences go out).

	The magical forest known as shadow grove has long been known as a place
in which even those with the best direction sense may be confused.  However,
it is the gateway to such places as the Galaxy, the Tower of High Sorcery,
and the Tower of the Draconians.  The route to the Grove is a well established
one.  Travel west from midgaard, until further travel west is no longer
possible.  Travel south until you can go west again, and then continue west.
Continuing in this manner, zigzagging west and south, the traveler will
eventually reach a dusty part of the forest.  From this point, travel north,
and west and north again.  From here the Entrance to Shadow Grove can be seen
to the north.

	Our experts recommend this method for traveling in the Grove itself.
In each new area, check all exits, and often you will be able to see if you
have reached the entrance to the spot you set out for.  Traveling in daylight
will often aid this process.  Also, our experts have noted that oftentimes,
traveling in the same direction twice will return you to the spot you left
from originally.  However, traveling north, then back south, for example, will
take you to a different area.

	The entrance to the Galaxy is said to be found by talking with a gypsy
in a tavern.  The entrances to the Towers of Sorcery and of the Draconians are
said to be gigantic Gates.  Also, if you see poor Edward, please be nice to
him, the poor fool can't seem to find his way out...

Seeing as there is a lack of worthy opponents who come to my land, I present
this map to the mapstore in Midgaard, with my instructions to reproduce it
for any who feel they are worthy.

Travel east of midgaard to the crossroads.  Turn north, until you may travel
east.  Go east until you may travel up a hill.  Continue up the hill to the
top, and continue east.  Then go down and enter the valley below you.
Continue east and north to the waterfall.  Continue north, and then take the
trail east as far as it goes.  Continue on the trail, going whichever way you
can, until the trail splits.   Travel east, and then go south.  You will be
in my realm, and may try to find your way to me.

We began our journey about mid-morning. We had hoped to get an early
start, but were held up while we waited for the shops to open so that
we could gather supplies for our expedition. The three of us were eager
to leave town after having either stolen from or killed nearly every
shopkeeper in Midgaard. The locals were not happy about our presence and
as such, we feared the Executioner might decide to take some action
against us if we remained. It was Hogar who had caused most of our
problems, but he also was a necessary part of our team. No one could
equal his skill with the sword, at least none we had previously encountered...
Whirl often tries to get Hogar to see how unnecessary a lot of his fighting
is, but he doesn't seem to listen to her divine guidance. I suppose that
as a thief, I usually end up doing a lot of the more mundane, but necessary
actions to get us where we need to go.  However, I enjoy the adventures I've
shared with these two, especially Whirl.  Without her, where would we, in
fact, where would I be now?

	Well, we set off from Midgaard along the river heading west away
from town, and although in full view due to the daylight we wanted to avoid,
the locals seemed more glad we had left than angry enough to give chase.
We went under the bridge which crosses the river and continued west.  As we
continued west there wasn't too much to see, the forest seemed to
grow darker as we moved, and long shadows seemed to be hiding some secret
danger, however nothing became of it.  Gradually we came to a split in the
river where it appeared to go around an island, which was more shadowed than
even the forest had been.  After some thought, we decide to brave it and
found a small spot where we could land and walk on the island's south side.
Following a farely difficult path, we found a small domocile.  Whirl seemed
to be upset about something here, and strangely so was Hogar, so we decided
not to press further and quickly left the island to continue going west along
the river.

	We noticed quickly that the river was getting much wider now,
and soon were at the mouth of the great river.  Not wanting to get too far
from land just yet, we entered the ocean and went south along the shoreline.
I must say at this point my arms were getting tired of paddling, so Whirl
graciously cast a spell which cause my body to have a density less than that
of air! Whirl did the same to Hogar, and this seemed to life our spirits a
little, as the going was made easier.  I wonder why she didn't think of this
sooner? Moving with the speed of the wind, we begin to find ourselves
reaching colder waters.  Reaching a point where we could no longer go south,
we continued to the west.  Wow!  It's a good thing Whirl cast that spell, the
waters here are so rough, I wonder how we would have survived in those canoes.
Another turn to the south leads us to much colder waters, we can see icebergs
floating in the ocean below us.  I'm getting dreadfully cold now and wish
we could turn back, but it seems we cannot and continue onward to the south.

	This is going to be my last entry.  It has been two days since last
I wrote.  We encountered an enormous white bear which so surprised us, it
managed to mortally wound Hogar, and I suffered several cuts before the bear
finally succumbed to the combined efforts of Whirl and I.  She had tried
desparately to help Hogar during the battle and afterwards, but the cold, along
with the seriousness of the wounds told us he wouldn't make it.  Hogar died
shortly there after. I'm afraid there may be more of those horrible beasts
in this place, but we can no more go forward, than we can go back.  At least
I am with Whirl.  The bear meat should be enough to keep us alive for a
little while, time enough for us to finally be alone together.
....

	This journal entry is one of many found in a book which had floated
in the ocean protected by some magical force from the water and salt.  The
finder can only guess at what happened to the two who were left. Hopefully
the directions from the book will help others avoid the same fate.

Those seeking the Eastern Desert should first purchase a canoe or
raft from the retired Captain, who can be found down by the river in Midgaard.
The following set of directions was obtained from the legendary mage
Shapeshifter, whom it is said spent so much time (lost?) in the desert, that
he finally killed off the nomad leader and made it his home.

	Shapeshifter reports that there are several interesting places that
may be visited from the eastern desert.  To get to the desert, the mage
recommends that one get upon the river and travel east.  The journey will
take the adventurer through an underground channel, until finally an under-
ground lake will be the last point at which boats will be used.  Continuing
east up a passageway will bring one to the edge of the desert.

	The desert is easy to lose one's way in, but such interesting areas
as MegaCity, the Pyramid of the Sphynx, the Nomad Camp, and the Lair of the
Brass dragon can be approached only from the desert.  Although even the great
Shapeshifter is not able to give exact directions, he was able to provide this
help.  The Brass Dragon's Lair is in a cave that one reaches from a ledge
that is plagued with strong gusts of wind.  MegaCity lies just over a small
hill.  And the Pyramid may only be entered by those willing to climb to the
top of the pyramid, although this is not as easy of a feat as one might think.

Many young adventures first make their fortunes in the Caves of Moria.
This is often attributed to the quick reproduction rates of the denizens of
the caves.  Such creatures as the kobold, the hobgoblin, and the hideous troll
can be found within the caves.  The caves are also reputed to be the base of
operations for several dangerous rogue mages.
	Those seeking the caves should first stock themselves with food and
water, as there is little of nourishment within the caves.  A few brave souls
who were lucky to make it out of the caves alive after running out of supplies,
report that the mushrooms that grow in the caves are not fit for human con-
sumption.  After acquiring supplies, travel out the east gate of Midgaard,
sticking to the roads as far as the Crossroads.  From there, a party must
wander north through the plains, until a cave mouth is reached.  This is the
entrance to Moria.
	Some things to take heed of about Moria.  Many adventurers have exited
the caves through a cavern to the north of the complex, and have then followed
a trail up the mountain.  Those foolish enough to do so have had to return to
town in failure, apparently too embarrassed to reveal what happened.  Also,
several adventurers have reported tangling with centipedes, climbing down a
hole to the west of the centipedes home, and then running into a powerful mage.
Many are the parties that have gone to attempt to recover corpses from this
powerful wizard.

It was during the invasion by Darkside the Beholder, that I first
journeyed to the Goblin Caverns.  Accompanied by Demonspawn the Warrior,
and Partan, I left town through the east gate.  We turned south at the
Crossroads, and pitched camp after traveling as far south as we were able.

	The next day, we turned east, zigzaggin east and south, until we went
down into a valley.  At this point, we turned north, following a trail
through the woods.

	At this point, we became somewhat lost, and had to wander for a while
before we found the entrance to the Goblin's mountain lair.  The assistance
of Odin didn't hurt of course.  Although I am not sure of the exact route,
I believe that we turned west and then back north at least once, and possibly
twice.  We found ourselves at the foot of the mountain, and were able to climb
it and enter the Goblin Caves.

	However, the most exciting part of our expedition occurred after we
had defeated Darkside (at the cost of Demonspawn, Partan, and several
younger adventurers who happened to be in the area).  I discovered a secret
door in the mountain side that opens into a store room, that directly
adjoins to the Goblin King's throne room.  If only Odin hadn't summoned us
back to his altar in Midgaard to reward us, I might have been able to find
out exactly where the secret door is.  All that I can say, is that it is in
the forest, and guarded by a Goblin Sentinel.

    After resting at the Temple of Midgaard I set off once again on my quest
for fame and fortune. I had heard stories of strange new lands to south so
it was south I headed,  After crossing the south bridge I turned west into
well known Goblin territory and fearing the worst I slipped into the shadows
and continued south pass an old Inn. I turned west then south after sneaking
past yet another Goblin ambush attempt.  Following the road I meet a weary
traveller with whom I chatted and rested with,  Once rested I continued south
and then east on the advice of the kind traveller, I almost turned back when
I noticed a faint trail through some bushes to the south, so once again I was
on my way, I decide to make camp at place known as shadow vale and continue on
in the morning...

    I awoke early next morning as planed and set off once again only travelling
in a south-west direction through a heavy Oak forest, It took several days and
the journey was uneventful but I was well stocked with food and water, took
regular rest and just enjoyed the scenery.   I followed the path down into a
valley where I meet a beautiful young woman who sang such powerful songs, and
although I was reluctant to leave I did so with a promise to return.  I headed
south then east just before a large tree into a large grassy plain.  The path I
followed from here is rather sketchy as I was attacked by vicious creatures and
pummelled by falling rock!, I was forced to run for my life, my only hope being
a large mountain range towards the east. I berley made it to the mountains with
my life and I was forced to rest and heal my wounds for days, but my deeds were
rewarded because as I emerged from the mountain pass I was greeted with a
spectacular view of the city of kerofk.

Who knows what adventures I might find there...

mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
   Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the entrance to Mud
