uncommon crow~
The Smithy's Set of the Crow.
Crow were the pseudo-pets of the smiths, often seen perching across a smithy's
forge in winter months basking in its heat and scavenging any food scraps That
were present. An ancient forging process imbues the essence of crow into the
armour sets, allowing them to take on properties of the black-feathered denizens.
