The briefing documents make for interesting reading. Essentially it seems that
this complex (`the Hive') is a large clan of vampires that support themselves
through selling their spying, stealing and murdering services to the highest
bidder. For a vampire clan they seem to have an unusual emphasis on discipline
and order, having arranged themselves into three distinct divisions with each
division having a number of ranks and being segregated into their own special
`wing' in the hive. In each division the most able and skilled individual is
elected by consensus to be in charge of their operations and report to an
`Overseer' about whom little is mentioned in these documents although it is
implied in places that he is responsible for decisions which affect the entire
group, as well as the clans' diplomatic dealings with other vampire groups and
organizations (some of whom seem to be among the most frequent contractors of
the clan's services).
    Flipping through the list of murder contracts taken out by vampires against
members of rival clans you grin, realizing humans are not alone amongst the sentient
creatures of this world in being their own worst enemies.~

Inside a sewerage drain~
You stand barely crouched inside a concrete sewerage pipe that lets out into a
stinking pool of liquidified waste to the immediate east. Raw effluent laps
against your ankles and it is a struggle to fight back the nausea that threatens
to bring you to your knees. You may travel east into the bog or continue further
into the pipe westward, hanging around here doesn't seem an attractive
proposition.

your head above the water level due to the sucking action and moist viscosity
of the caliginous bog (similar in texture to porridge though somewhat less edible).
To the south and east the tunnel inclines and the mire becomes more shallow,
permitting you to wade. If you get out of here alive you might consider having
your adventuring equipment professionally cleaned.

Reception room ~
You stand in a small room in an underground burrow or hive, such as those
fashioned by giant burrowing beetles but with a clearly more human intelligence
responsible for the decor and general aesthetic. Pale green light-orbs have been
fastened strategically about the walls, illuminating the room with a dim glow,
sufficient to enable you to see clearly without the aid of your own
light-source.

This appears to be a reception area of some sort, evidenced by the plain wooden
chairs set about the room and the small room lying to the south into which you
can see courtesy of a hole (window?) that has been dug into it. The small room
can be walked into via a opening to the southwest, while a door has been set into
the far western wall, presumably leading farther into the complex.

The door through which you entered to the east has mysteriously disappeared, leaving
only a handle in the wall which seems to do nothing. There is magic at work here.

way to avoid being slathered with the muck as you travel through here.

A loud hissing comes from below, accompanied by the sloshing and slapping

You stand inside a medium sized walk in freezer. Humanoid carcasses in various

lay handy to assist the peckish vampire in the consumption of their ghoulish
feast. The only exit is back south, into the abattoir.

 understand the idea of them being perpetually hungry for something they will never
 have is particularly amusing to him.. regardless, if these most recent curses are
 similar in character to previous ones of his we've studied then the breaking of them
 will result in the generation of a powerful magical artifact.. one of our contacts
 in the vale has communicated reports of their activity in that area.. recommend
 to the Spymaster for possible investigation, perhaps we could send an agent in to
 infiltrate their forest in the guise of a wolf?"

 most important and powerful individuals and we are well on our way to being ready
 to start construction of a new hive close to there.. while Solace is meeting our
 food requirements at the present moment, with current growth figures we look to be
 overkilling this area within 5 years and will require a city of greater
 population density to support us. As you know, various alternative sites have been
 proposed, of which Krondor is only one, but in both my personal opinion and in the
 opinion of the entire spy division it is the superior in every meaningful respect.."

It starts into a long tirade detailing the perceived advantages of Krondor over
various other cities in the realm as regards food quality, the relative difficulty
in obtaining it etc. You lose interest and put the file back.

 troubled us little. Their poor organizational skills and lack of ability to
 cooperate make it seem unlikely that they will ever seriously threaten our dominance,
 however it would be a grave mistake to cease monitoring their activities altogether
 as the amount of raw power represented by the clans is not inconsiderable. My strategic

"..While Faraq remains in the Vale we must avoid conflict with the `leech' group..
 being as territorial as they are this shouldn't be too hard (we can just avoid the
 vale altogether) but this is complicated by our mutual interest in the gypsies
 and impaired by the difficulties that many of them (being an animalist strain) have
 in communicating clearly. I suggest we involve the spy division most principally
 in dialogues with them when they are necessary, as we have the skills required to
 meet them in their milieu, as it were."

You stand at the foot of a ladder at the beginning of what judging by the
smell and dampness can only be a sewer tunnel. This area is dimly lit by
the light from the opening above, revealing a large circular tunnel made
of concrete that enters immediately into impenetrable darkness as soon as
you move north of the area in which you now stand. Cold air blows through
the tunnel, bringing with it a feeling of hostility and menace so intense
as to be almost tangible.
