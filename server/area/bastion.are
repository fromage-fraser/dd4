Dark shadows swirl and churn about you in an unnatural way. They seem to be
trying to cling to your body and you flail your arms about attempting to shake
them off. Now and then you see strange demonic faces form in the shadows only to
disappear again a moment later. To the north and east the cliff drops away but
you are unable to tell how far down the ground is here as the shadows are
completely obscuring your view.

A shadowy portal hangs in the air.

The dungeon~
There is a torch burning in a sconce affixed to the cavern wall which allows you
to see a small distance around you, But also allowing anyone nearby to see you
silhouetted in its glow.

The dungeon~
There is a torch burning in a sconce affixed to the cavern wall and you can see
in grim detail the stone altar beneath it. The top of the altar is neatly
arranged with many grisly devices of torture. Amongst them is an extensive
collection of whips, knives and clamps. In the centre is a crystal ball with
several vials of red liquid beside it.

stone altar~
The stone altar has steel hoops embedded in the four corners of its surface,
which you assume are used to tether intended torture victims. Since no-one is
currently upon it many instruments of pain are arranged there. Amongst them a
deadly looking cat of nine tails stands out as it has spiked barbs of wire woven
in with the leather thongs.

crystal ball~
The crystal ball is clouded with swirling grey mist and you are unable to see

The dungeon~
It is ominously dark in this corner of the cavern making it difficult to see

hostile that might be lurking nearby.

You are in bare stone chamber. The only thing in the room is a marble pedestal
with a large crystal ball on top which is standing near the far wall. As you
walk over to it for a better look you notice that the wall behind it is not
completely stable, shimmering white energies ripple across the surface of the
stone. You absently rest your hand on the crystal ball as you lean against the
pedestal and think about how far from home you really are. Suddenly your
attention is draw back to the wall as in image begins to appear there -- it's your
home! You snatch your hand away from the crystal and take a step backwards, the
image disappears. The purpose of the room becomes clear to you, it is for remote
viewing. A chill runs down your spine at the thought of these creatures
possessing such a powerful tool.

A hidden passage~
You are in a large stone tunnel that appears to have been chiselled from the
rock. There are cobwebs hanging from the roof thick with dust and the surface of
the ancient floor has been worn smooth with the passage of time.

The tunnel stretches away into darkness towards the north and west.

A hidden passage~
You are in a large stone tunnel that appears to have been chiselled from the
rock. A layer of fine dirt sifts down the from above and you brush it from your
hair as you try to decide where it came from, the roof is solid stone.

The tunnel stretches away into darkness towards the south.
