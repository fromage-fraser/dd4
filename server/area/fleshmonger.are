the patrolling guard~
The patrolling guard greets you as you enter the room.
~
The patrolling guard is an aberration, an insane cross between a human and a
goblin.  He is well-armoured and intent on stopping you entering the tower.

guard hybrid duty~
the on-duty guard~
The on-duty guard hulks across the room towards you.
~
The on-duty guard was apparently doing some work at a rickety table before he
saw you enter the tower through the opening in the door.  Now he wants to stop
you getting any further into his master's domain.  Like his partner in the
foyer, he is some sort of goblin/human hybrid.

the mufti guard~
The mufti guard rises from his bunk as he sees you.
~
The off-duty guard, dressed simply in mufti pants, seems to have been having
a nap.  Your presence has awoken him, however, and he probably isn't too happy
about that.  He appears to be a cross between a human and an orc.

The cook appears to be human, one of the few in residence in this tower.  He

The on-duty guard oversees the prisoners.

This on-duty guard is responsible for overseeing the prisoners.  Even though
he appears to be playing some sort of crude card game with his partner, he
keeps one eye on the stairwell outside the room.  He seems to be some sort of
human/goblin hybrid.

a hybrid prisoner~
A hybrid prisoner cowers in the corner here.
~
This prisoner is clearly a result of some sort of experiment, probably the
same experiment that produced the guards in the foyer and guard room.  He
seems to be a cross between a human and a goblin, but is not as well-trained
as his guards.  He doesn't appear to be able to talk.

appears to be a cross between a human and an orc, but is not as well trained

goblin.

This room has two sets of bunks on either side, enough room to sleep eight
guards.  Four of the beds are currently occupied.  There are rushes on the

strange-looking scientific apparatus and bits of equipment.  Lamps are
stationed here and there.  Books are scattered on every other available
surface.  There are no windows.  In two places under the desk, there are
sleeping pallets.  One is more luxurious than the other.  There is a stairwell
