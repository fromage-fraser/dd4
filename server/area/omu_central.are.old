being of lawful and good alignment, but that this also means they're likely to
be extremely haughty and arrogant. This Triton looks quite beaten-down and
world-weary.  You imagine this is not how he saw his life turning out.

You recognise this blue-skinned, fairly-handsome-if-vaguely-fishy-looking

folk. You know that Triton dedicate themselves to protecting magical portals
from sahuagin, kraken, and other monstrous beings of the sea and so tend towards
being of lawful and good alignment, but that this also means they're likely to
be extremely haughty and arrogant. This Triton looks quite beaten-down and
world-weary.  You imagine this is not how she saw her life turning out.

with long, webbed fingers and toes, and visible gills on their ribs.  This

squalid surroundings.  She is obviously miserable, traumatised, and

Central Omu, Lower~
<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. Omu has
been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

While Omu's crude wooden palisade blocks further travel south and west, you can
explore the city to the north and east, or swim up, towards a huge, looming area
of darkness above your head. The mud at your feet looks to have been recently
disturbed.

Central Omu, Upper~
<22>You are floating about 4 metres above the ground inside the fortified grung city
of Omu, deep under the sea.  The city is full of coral and mud tree-like
<28>structures in which the grung live and work, and elaborate rope bridges that
criss-cross the city, connecting the dwellings to each other.

<34>Omu's wooden palisade prevents movement south or west, and there is no access
from here to the rope bridge network that lies north, but you can travel further
<40>into the upper part of the city to the east, head down to the sea floor, or swim
up, into the huge, looming area of darkness swirling above your head.

Central Omu, Lower~
<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. Omu has
been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

While Omu's crude wooden palisade blocks further travel south and east, you can
explore the city to the north and west, or swim up, towards a huge, looming area
of darkness above your head.

Drogk's Apothecary~
<215>You stand inside the lower level of an underwater dwelling that resembles a
large, hollowed-out tree, but is made from coral, ancient stone, scavenged
<214>materials, and a variety of aquatic plant life, often patched together with a
hard, mud-like substance. This dwelling serves as Omu's apothecary, and jars and
<208>packages of various foul-looking and -smelling pills, potions, and unguents
fill the shelves that have been hacked haphazardly into the dwelling's walls. A
large portion of this room has been magically aerated in order that Drogk's
patrons can sample his smokeables, should they wish to.

<202>From here you can travel east, out into the main city of Omu, or head up to
Omu's communal spellcrafting workshop.<0>

<130>You stand inside the upper level of an underwater dwelling that resembles a
large, hollowed-out tree, but is constructed from coral, ancient stone,
<136>scavenged materials, and a variety of aquatic plant life, often patched together
with a hard, mud-like substance.  This dwelling has been transformed into a
<137>rowdy bar by its owner, Kulp, with patrons coming and going at all hours and the
usual loud bickering and jostling that attends a congregation of drunken Grung.

<138>From here you can travel north, east, west or south out to one of the rope
bridges that connects locations in the upper level of Omu, or down to the
butcher's shop on the lower level.<0>

#28462
Central Omu, Lower~
<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. Omu has
been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

While Omu's rope bridge network blocks travel up, and the grung dwelling to your
west has no entrance from here, you can still explore the city to the north,
east and south of this location.

Central Omu, Rope Bridge~
<185>You are deep underwater standing on a tall, wide rope bridge that connects
various locations in the upper part of the grung city of Omu. The bridge appears
<186>to have been woven from fibrous parts of various underwater plants and
reinforced with strands of (presumably scavenged) wire. It sways gently in the
<187>ocean current.

You may travel north or south along the rope bridge network from here, west to
<188>enter some sort of a grung dwelling-structure, or directly up, into the
swirling, ominous cloud of darkness in the water above your head.<0>

#28478
Central Omu, Lower~
<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. The
city's design suggests the grung preference for arboreal structures, with
<114>dwellings constructed from coral, stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic
the swampy, tree-like habitats preferred by more amphibious grung.

<113>Most striking is the network of rope bridges that connect the grung dwellings
at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater plants and
<112>reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently in the
ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative web.

While the crude hardwood palisade the grung have erected about their city
prevents further movement north or east, you can explore the city further to the
west or south from here, or swim up, towards a huge, looming area of darkness
in the water above your head.

Central Omu, Upper~
<22>You are floating about 4 metres above the ground inside the fortified grung city
of Omu, deep under the sea.  The city is full of mostly-coral tree-like
<28>structures in which the grung dwell, and elaborate rope bridges that criss-cross
the city, connecting the dwellings to each other.

<34>While the crude hardwood palisade the grung have erected about their city
prevents further movement north or east, you can explore the city further to the
<40>west or south from here, head down to the sea floor, or swim up, into the huge,
looming area of darkness swirling above your head.

Central Omu, Lower~
<115>You stand inside the fortified grung city of Omu, deep under the sea. Omu has
been built on top of the ruins of a much older city, and its design suggests the
<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

You can freely explore the city to the north, south, and east of this location,
while the western gates of Omu lie to your immediate west. The city's rope
bridge network prevents any travel upwards.

various locations in the upper part of the grung city of Omu. The bridge appears
<186>to have been woven from fibrous parts of various underwater plants and
reinforced with strands of (presumably scavenged) wire. It sways gently in the
<187>ocean current.

You may travel north, east and south along the rope bridge network from here, or
<188>swim directly up, into the swirling, ominous cloud of darkness in the water above

<114>grung preference for arboreal structures, with dwellings constructed from coral,
stone, and salvaged artefacts that mimic the swampy, tree-like habitats
<113>preferred by more amphibious grung.

Most striking to an outsider is the network of rope bridges that connect these
<112>dwellings at their upper storeys. Woven from the strong fibres of underwater
plants and reinforced with strands of scavenged wire, these bridges sway gently
in the ocean currents, linking the citizens of Omu in a literal and figurative
web.

While Omu's rope bridge network blocks travel up, and the grung dwelling to your
north has no entrance from here, you can still explore the city to the south,
west and east of this location.

Central Omu, Rope Bridge~
<185>You are deep underwater standing on a tall, wide rope bridge that connects
various locations in the upper part of the grung city of Omu. The bridge appears
<186>to have been woven from fibrous parts of various underwater plants and
reinforced with strands of (presumably scavenged) wire. It sways gently in the
<187>ocean current.

You may travel south or east along the rope bridge network from here, enter some
<188>sort of grung dwelling to the north, or swim directly up, into the swirling,
ominous cloud of darkness in the water above your head.<0>

You can explore the city to the south, west, or east from here, though the
wooden palisade that surrounds the city prevents further movement north, and the
city's rope bridge network prevents travel up. You can see a very large and
grand fountain just to the west. The mud at your feet looks to have been
recently disturbed.

<208>diligently serving the missile-weaponry needs of the city's warriors and hunters.
You notice that as well as obviously grung-made missile weapons, the store
includes items sourced (stolen? scavenged?) from elsewhere in the Domain.

<202>From here you can travel west, out into the main city of Omu, or head up to

Inside a Grung Home~
<130>The interior of this Grung home is a damp, dimly lit space, carved directly out
of the seabed's rugged bedrock. The walls are uneven and rough, with patches of
mud and silt clinging to the surfaces. Small pockets of bioluminescent algae
cling to the walls, casting a faint, eerie glow that barely illuminates the
chamber. The floor is thick with a layer of soft, squelchy mud, which emits a
slight earthy scent mixed with the briny tang of the sea.

The space is sparse, with a few rudimentary furnishings fashioned from coral,
driftwood, and scavenged materials. These pieces are functional, if primitive,
and blend seamlessly with the natural environment.

The main way in or out of the home is through a small, round hatch in the
ceiling, made from reinforced kelp and scavenged metal, which leads up to the
bustling city of Omu above. A small hole in the east wall looks like it would be
a tight fit, but you can probably squeeze into it.<0>

Inside a Grung Home~
<130>The interior of this Grung home is a damp, dimly lit space, carved directly out
of the seabed's rugged bedrock. The walls are uneven and rough, with patches of
mud and silt clinging to the surfaces. Small pockets of bioluminescent algae
cling to the walls, casting a faint, eerie glow that barely illuminates the
chamber. The floor is thick with a layer of soft, squelchy mud, which emits a
slight earthy scent mixed with the briny tang of the sea.

The space is sparse, with a few rudimentary furnishings fashioned from coral,
driftwood, and scavenged materials. These pieces are functional, if primitive,
and blend seamlessly with the natural environment.

The main way in or out of the home is through a small, round hatch in the
ceiling, made from reinforced kelp and scavenged metal, which leads up to the
bustling city of Omu above. There are also small holes in the north and east
walls of the dwelling you think you could squeeze through.

<56>You find yourself in a vast, oppressive underwater prison. The water is thick
with a sense of malaise; its eerie stillness broken only by the occasional groan
or distant wail of an unseen creature.  Visibility fades quickly in all
directions, concealing whatever dangers may lurk in the murky depths. Rough-hewn
sea rock prevents travel north, west, or up; you may venture in any other
