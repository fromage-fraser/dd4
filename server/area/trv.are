The Travellers (Clan TRV)

The Travellers are a fellowship of wayfarers, wanderers, explorers and
hunters who roam the great expanses of the 'Domain.  The libraries of the
Travellers are vast and they are always looking for new maps, new magical
items, and wonderous creations of magic and nature. They maintain centres
of learning throughout the domain, and members freely pass on their
knowledge in their areas of expertise.

The Travellers' members pursue their own interests and are as diverse as
nature itself, from explorers to librarians to barbarians.  They are bound
together by interests in exploration, discovery and a love of the wild.

Approaching the Gypsy Encampment~
Heading further into the woods you hear voices and the crackle of open
fires further south.  Pushing aside thick branches you see a small grassy
clearing in the distance; it is filled with brightly coloured tents.  You
wonder whether to press further into the open.  Dark shadows move slowly
amongst the trees nearby.

Gypsy Encampment~
Four large tents are clustered together here at the centre of this grassy
clearing.  A few tired horses are tethered to a nearby tree.  Smoke drifts
lazily through vents in several of the tents, and you hear the deep murmur
of voices within.  The ground is muddy in parts and you see many different
footprints.
     A bright fire burns between the lodgings; thick tree trunks have been
arranged about it as seating.  A few ragged looking gypsies relax in front
of the flames and talk quietly.  An older man with wild black hair stands
up at your approach and asks, "Are you friend or foe?"

Inside the Gypsy's Tent~
The inside of Lyanka's tent is warm and filled with the pungent aroma of
burning incense.  Plump cushions and soft furs cover the floor, and the
atmosphere is very calm and relaxing.  The soft orange light from a small
fire makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.  The door south will take
you back to the clearing.

Inside the Gypsy's Tent~
Small unkempt children lay asleep under brightly woven blankets, the dying
embers of a small fire casting a gentle heat throughout the tent.  An old
gypsy woman sits quietly, watching over them.  Her keen eyes glance over
you as you enter; her gaze is deep and steady.  You can leave through the
door to the east.

Inside the Gypsy's Tent~
Sacks, small wooden chests, woven bags, baskets and pots are haphazardly
stacked throughout the whole of this tent; there is barely room to move
about.  Piles of apparent trash cover the floor.  Who could tell how
valuable the contents of this storeroom might be, and where it was all
stolen from?  You can head north back into the clearing from here.

Inside the Gypsy's Tent~
This tent is used for preparing and cooking food.  A large fire has been
made in the centre of the floor, think tendrils of grey smoke rising
through vents in the roof of the tent.  Blackened pots sit perched in the
flames, releasing rich, savoury aromas.  A small group of gypsy women tend
the meal and talk quietly, laughing and occasionally singing.  The only
way out appears to be to the west.
