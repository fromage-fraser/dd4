       Page 4 - The Master

1 one dragons domain~
You make out the follwing:

   If you are reading this, then you must use all the information
contained in this book to use, for without it, your quest for
peace will fail. My name is Achros. I was captured along with most
of my village and taken to another domain - the Dragons Domain
where we live as slaves. I have taken to documenting as much
information as possible so that one day it can be used by our
saviours to free us, and destroy the tyranny that theatens to
invade our home-land. If Zyklor has made it to our home-realm, then I
fear you may be too late. We currently live in a small make-shift
village just to the south west of the Master's castle.
Our village leader - Drynax, tries to keep our moral high, but he
and the more senior villagers, of which I am one, know that our
time is soon running out, for the invasion of our home land will
soon be upon us. If you meet Drynax, mention my name.
The master of whom I spoke of earlier is the Dragons leader,
no-one knows his name, he is just refered to as the Master.
The Dragons he commands keep us here to do their
bidding. We tend their crops, fish their river, and clean their
stables. They allow us only limited access to their castle, so
I will tell you what I know if it on the next page.~
E
2 two castle~
The Dragons Castle is huge. Obviously it would have to be in order
to house so many large vile beasts. The main and only entrance is
on the south of the castle. Upon entering there is a vast courtyard.
Many of our villagers work within the courtyard, pedling food and
clothing carts. The Stables are on the eastern side of the courtyard.
Within our people tend the Dragons pets. On each corner of the
main coutyard stands a tower. Each tower is 3 levels high, although
the barracks to the northwest also has a basement, where prisoners
are kept. Each tower has a special role to play in the Masters plans
to conquer our home-realm. The NorthWestern Tower is the barracks for
all the Dragon warriors. The NorthEastern is essentially a weapons
factory. The SouthEastern a armour factory, and to date no one knows
what the SouthWestern tower does. Reports of strange lights on its
top floor have been made.
In the center of the courtyard is the main tower. This is 5 levels
high, and is thought to be where the Master resides. It is rumored
that you cannot gain access to the main tower without 4 items from
the 4 surrounding towers. these 4 items are kept by the Masters 4
sons who each work on the top level of their respective tower.
The sons are the subject of page 3.~
E
3 three sons~
The Master has 4 sons.
Zyklew. He lives in the Southeastern tower. It is understood he is
a master armor maker. Not much else is known about him.
Zynrack. A master weapons maker, he lives in the northeastern tower.
It is understood that he takes great delight in seeing his weapons
at work, especially on our kind. It is believed he has perfected a
weapon that can kill in one blow.
Zyklor. 14 Full moons ago Zyklor appeared within our village, and
took us back to his realm. It was this date that the Master had
perfected his portal into our realm. Zyklor was sent to our realm
to capture us, and also to get a foothoold so that when the invasion
came, the Master and his hordes would know when and where to attack.
Zynranth. Very little information is known about this dragon, apart
from the fact that he works in the South-Western Tower.~
E
4 four master~
The Master
An ancient Dragon. He has come to power by destroying all before him.
Links to the ancient druids have been made. The druids upon fearing
his uprise banished the ONE to the 4 portals.
He is ruthless. It is believed he killed his own wife as she did not
agree with his plans to invade our realm. He will not waste anytime
in turning you to dust. His Name is a mystery, it is only know to his
4 sons. There is a very good reason why it is secret. It is almost
as though he fears hearing his own name. the Master is on the verge
of sending his massive army into our realm to conquer it. You
must stop him..
~
E
5 five portal~
Knowing that the Master and his sons had developed the means to
get to the other worlds, I had to get through there portal and
warn our homeland and all who lived there. I managed to get a job
serving The Masters minions in the main castle. The advantage of
this, is that I heard things. I overhead Zyklor and one
of his brothers talking. They had been through to the portal
to a world where "puny mortals" roamed looking for fame and fortune.
These mortals often had a inquisitive nature, and so the portal
on there realm was set up in such a away as to allow easy access
from the Dragons realm to our realm, but coming back, if you did not
have the right key, it contained a series of monsters, and traps
that would surely end the un-weary. The did mention a word that
should be uttered to gain an Ankh, one of the keys to the portals
inner door. That word was obsidian. I took it upon my self to
warn the people on the other side of the portal. One night, when all
was quite, I was able to gain access to the portal chamber.
thinning all was quiet, I stepped toward the portal, just as I
was about to enter, the roar of a fireball was heard, and I was
hit in the side, the force of the blast sent me through the
portal into my home realm. As I crawled toward the light
of the cave mouth a hobbit seing my pain, took me in and aided me.
He was able to provide a little healing, enough for me to finish
this book. Take heed of what is written within these pages, as it

Escape from Hell~
Suddenly all is quiet. The red glow from the hole in the floor slowly
subsides, as the lava stops just beneath teh gaping hole in the floor
beneath you. The acrid burning blue smoke slowly dissapates.
The two huge Dragon doors to the north and south have collapsed into
the hallway, making them impassable. The only way out are the huge
double doors to the east.
