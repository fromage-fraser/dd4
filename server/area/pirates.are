The frozen captive is so gratified by your kindness that
she tells you a story:

'A long time ago, Lok started this area, and had major
writers' block. Well, Simba sort of nudged him and he broke
out of his block. With Rainman doing the main debugging and
a lot of dark beer, this area was created for your amusement.
The secret to sailing is that all simple seas never border
on grounding reefs. If you are in shallows type exit after
each move to look for shoals ( they won't show in the night ).
There is a main clockwise current running in the high seas.
There are a lot of clues throughout isles so don't just
powermud and miss them all. Lok charmed me so you wouldn't

inscription strange rock~
Carved into the rock in wizard runes is the following:
` BEWARE-Enchanted Lodestone: I was on holiday on this
deserted island, practicing on my enchantment spells,
when in the middle of casting, I was rudely interrupted by
a mystic summons. The interruption threw my spell off target
and onto the island itself. With a wrenching crunch the whole
island rose from the sea to the position you find it now.
Intrigued by the phenomena I took a sample of the rock back
to my shack in the Forest Arden, where I determined by
methods of alchemy that the island had rich deposits of
lodestone, which when subjected to enchantment magic, flies.
I have used this discovery to create several floating trinkets
which impart the ability of flying to the recipient. Beware
for I know not how long this enchantment will last. - MERLIN'

Sailing the Sea of Ice~
You are sailing the sea of ice. The channel is poor at best, with
ice pressing in on all sides. The iceberg looms closer with each day.
The wind whips along unhindered across the flat ice, chilling you
to the core.

Sailing the Sea of Ice~
You are sailing the sea of ice. Ahead the narrow channel widens next
to a very large iceberg. Ice shears in sheets from the iceberg to crash
with a thunderous roar into the frosty sea. You think you can make out
a dark watery cave leading into the iceberg.

Inside the Iceberg~
You have sailed into the heart of the iceberg, out of the frosty wind.
You feel warmth returning to your bones, and you welcome the quiet
splendor of the ice interior. Next to you in the cave are several triremes
anchored at bay. You anchor and hop down onto the hard packed ice,
following a trail of footprints to a dead end passage. Puzzled, you get on
your hands and knees, and feel the outline of an ice trap door beneath you.

At the Bonfire in the Great Ice Cavern~
You stand next to a roaring bonfire in the great ice cavern. Logs some ten
feet in length are stacked crosswise to a height of 5'. The flames warm and
light the cavern, and most importantly, your backside. Bedrolls are cast
about the fire, and primitive shelving has been carved into the surrounding
stalagmites. The heat from the fire is so great that it has melted the ice into
a pool of water.

cavern, the walls have been covered with tapestries of depicting woodland
hunting scenes. A canopied bed is on the eastern half of the room, and a desk
on the western half. Two fires are lit here, well illuminating the room.
Carpeting covers the floor shorn of its stalagmites. Your spells flicker and
dim here. A rope ladder leads up.
