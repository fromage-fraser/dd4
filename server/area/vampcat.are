dying man drunk naked~
a dying man~
A man lies motionless on the ground. Probably a drunk who wandered in for the night.
~
When you look more closely at the sleeping man you realize your original
assumption that he's a drunkard whose friends have stolen his clothes for a
laugh is erroneous. The man is near death and seriously in need of immediate
medical assistance. He sports large bruises all over his body and blood trickles
from puncture wounds in the back of his neck.

Anton man~
Anton~
Anton reclines here, stroking his chin and looking thoughtful.
~
A short bearded man sits here, dressed rather flamboyantly. He regards you with
an odd mixture of amusement and contempt as if deciding whether to engage you in
intelligent conversation or rip your still-beating heart from your mangled
corpse. When he smirks at you a little wider you're sure those are fangs you see.

Greg~
Greg is here, smirking stupidly.
~
Greg is a scruffy looking individual with an obvious penchant for overindulgence.
You wouldn't trust him as far as you could throw him and keep a close eye on
your money and his hands accordingly. As you hold his gaze you can't help but be
distracted by the trickle of blood running down his chin. Hmm.

Saturnina dominatrix mistress~
Saturnina~
Saturnina stands here in her dominatrix uniform, preening and cracking her whip.
~
6ft tall and tightly clad in a black leather dominatrix uniform, Saturnina makes
quite an impression. She smiles at you and cracks her whip. "You've been a Very
Naughty Person and the Mistress is going to have to PUNISH you!"

Saturnina's eyes narrow and she advances.

kitten Steigen cat~
Steigen the kitten~
A tiny black kitten sits here, mewling piteously.
~
Steigen looks malnourished and unhealthy. Doubtless Saturnina bought him on a
whim and then abandoned him to his own devices when she realised that he needed
to be looked after - after all she had a social life to lead! You can't help but
feel sorry for the pathetic little mite. He regards you mournfully with his big
sad kitten eyes.

Cyril~
Cyril is here, making use of the facilities.
~
Cyril has the look of a man (well except for the pointy teeth) who is profoundly
irritated at having been disturbed answering the call of nature, as would we all
be. Of course the difference here is that Cyril is a bloodthirsty half-vampire
and is liable to do more about the intrusion than your average Joe Shmoe. Like
sever your head from your body and pull your lungs out through your neck. Oh well.

Joan stands in the shower, washing her hair.

Joan stands here naked in the shower tray, her long wet hair draped languorously
about her lithe frame. You imagine she'd be hard for a lot of men to resist.
Actually you notice her hair looks to be in particularly great condition--bet
she's using some mighty expensive hair cleaning products. Uhm.. don't think
she'll be too happy about being disturbed..

Ganymede man vampire~
Ganymede~
Ganymede dances about, twirling his firestaff.
~
Ganymede is a fit young bare chested man, covered in tattoos and piercings who
stands here twirling his flaming staff high into the air and catching it, all
the while cackling with insane glee. His attention turns to you and he smiles,

"I must assume you have met my pets and bested them or found another means of
gaining entrance to my chamber. A pity if the former, for I laboured many hours
over their creation and perfection as you can plainly see. No pun intended."

He indicates the eyeless bodies in a pile behind him and continues,

"I think the time has come for me to deal with you myself, your intrusion into
our coven can no longer be tolerated and there are many here who must feed,
myself amongst them."

With that he ceases the twirling and turns to you, his burning stave leveled at
your chest.

"Come forward. The Hunger is upon me."

~
Grok, while not overly tall is a fearsome sight. He stands almost as wide as tall
and every inch muscle. Clad in chain mail armor and wielding a sword that dwarfs him
he glares at you with cold fury.

"Thou shalt come no further. I hold Herne's key and thou wilt take it only from
mine corpse." He swings his massive blade, "I advise thee to turn tail whilst thou hast
yet legs to convey thee, as mine patience hath already been sorely tested this day."

"I await thy decision."

"You are trespassing in my sanctum. You will die this day."

you detect a heavy odour of liquor on her breath and the cause of her peculiar
distress is made manifest.

Caroline is as pickled as a baby onion.

A large creature made of metamorphic vampire flesh floats here, insensate.

A Wamphyri Warrior is basically an undead version of a flesh golem, fashioned by
the skilful use of vampire magiks, alchemy and undead flesh. This one stands a
full 10 feet tall and is as yet not fully formed, you can only imagine how much
more intimidating it would appear out of the vat and heavily armoured, as it is
its sharp fangs dripping with noxious Wamphyri poison gives you pause for thought.

Spindly and lithe with heads resembling those of giant mosquitos, Siphoneers are
bred to ingest and `purify' (make fit for vampire consumption) ordinary
foodstuffs, invaluable when hunting is lean or in times of war. They spend most
of their miserable lives bounded by machines which pump the food into them and
then extract and package it after it has been digested. You'd be doing this one
a favour by ending its life before it begins.

one amongst those who are fear incarnate?

"His downfall", you think.

He barely glances up before returning to his alchemical and necromantic labours.

Xundus reads your mind and knows your purpose,

"So, you would kill the Wamphyri and avenge the death of men? Men who die as
cattle in a slaughterhouse before us, whose weakly flesh provide us with raw
material for our creatures and sustenance for ourselves? You might try,
adventurer, but you will surely fail, for we are Wamphyri and we have ever been
and ever will be."

With that Xundus rises from his chair and gestures, mumbling under his breath -
you catch the word `biofeedback' and suddenly a brilliant white aura surrounds
his form.

"Now you will die intruder, for already you have seen and know too much."

With his haughty expression and antiquated dress sense, Mavralyn looks the
conservative sort of vampire. You'd imagine he wouldn't hold much truck with
new-fangled notions of fashion and propriety. No sir, Mavralyn likes it black
and he likes it sinister. You bet he loves nothing better than to lurk and creep
about in the darkness, biting necks and baring his fangs.

As you stand regarding him he continues to measure you up, his eyes flicking
back every now and again to the recessed areas behind him, as if considering
them a possible escape route...

A half-dragon bouncer stands here in his dark suit and shades, his face grim.
~
It was realized quite some time ago by people in positions of influence that
half-dragon mercenaries made excellent unwanted-guest-discouragers. The one
standing before you with his arms folded is a fine physical example of his kind,
standing nearly 10 foot tall and nearly as much again wide. You notice a trickle
of smoke drift from his nasal slits and decide it's likely he has even more than
raw pummelling power up his sleeves.

He looks like he could chew you up and spit you out.

Well something clearly isn't right. The leg is quite obviously moving of its own
accord. Hmm.. if it moves you imagine it can be killed.

Porl~
Porl~
Porl regards you quixotically.
~
Porl regards you curiously for a second before deciding to speak.

"I have not seen your like here for some time. Perhaps you have come to see the
exhibition and accidentally stumbled into my abode. I suggest you leave the way
you came in, the exhibition, which is clearly signposted, lies to the far south
at the end of the corridor. I bid you farewell and return to my artistic
contemplation."

Porl leans back against the wall and closes his eyes in silent meditation.

Nathaniel~
A dark and shadowy presence lurks here.
~
Peering at the misty figure you discern a elegantly-dressed vampire at its heart.
Nathaniel seems bemused by your presence here but secure in his power, considers
you to be no threat to him.

The nude sculpture~
A naked marble woman stands here, her hands gesturing towards you.
~
The sculpture is so lifelike it embarrasses you to look at it, the woman seems
to be staring straight at you with a look of wicked amusement on her face. You
marvel thinking of the talent required to construct such a piece.

Scorpios~
Scorpios smiles at your entrance.
~
Scorpios is a tall, sharp-looking male vampire dressed impeccably in an
expensive grey silk suit. Unruffled by your intrusion he has assumed you're
simply another gallery visitor who's found their way here looking for a little
`extra' entertainment. He informs you that he can obtain for you a wide variety
of mind-altering substances at short notice... for a price.

Charles~
Charles regards you loftily.
~
You can't help thinking this tall, cadaverous man looks faintly ridiculous in
his `Vampyres R Us' hand-me-downs. The collar of his black velvet cloak shoots
up a good foot above his head and his ambassadorial attire creates the impression
of a man trying too hard to give the plebs what they expect.

Symon~
Symon stares at the wall, his heart wrenched by grief.
~
The quintessential archetype of the tortured loner, Symon sighs deeply at your
entrance and begins,

"Long have I struggled with the beast and yet ever it defeats me. Feed as long
as I might on lesser animals always I return to human flesh. The blood is the
life, my friend, and I can no more escape it than I can my own immortal existence."

Symon gestures at his canvasses,

"If I cannot be cured then at least I might spend my days fostering understanding
in the population. It is all that sustains me."

Symon sighs, sits down and resumes his contemplation.

A pale, distant looking woman looks up at your entrance.
~
This drab, colourless middle-aged woman staffs the Galleria's foyer desk. She
regards you with bored resignation, her face displaying not the slightest flicker
of emotion. Something about her faintly greenish pallor strikes you as odd and
the old legends of ghouls - human slaves bound by blood to their vampyre masters -
spring to mind.

A jet black horse is here, snorting and pawing the ground.
~
This demonic creature was brought into being through dark magiks enacted by the
half-vampyre warlock Herne. It stands at least 20 hands high, dwarfing any ordinary
mount. You notice faint wisps of smoke drift from its nostrils and decide it
would be a foolish individual indeed that would treat this mount with disrespect.

Christian~
A man lies here on a mattress, drooling and insensate.
~
So slovenly is this individual's appearance you find it hard to believe vampiric
blood courses through his veins. The odour that emanates from his direction is
inordinately offensive even at this distance and his clothes and the mattress on
which he lies are stained dark red with his own urine. You briefly consider it
odd that this vampire, with his enhanced sensory powers, has not yet noticed your
entrance into his abode - and then your gaze slips to the syringe he still
clutches fiercely in his right hand.

vampires everywhere to act in a spirit of moderation and humility when taking
life and consuming blood.

A tall, foppish vampire in a black silk shirt regards you with distaste.
~
Augus regards you with thinly-disguised contempt; not, you perceive, because
you've disturbed his activities but because you appear to him to be of a low
academic pedigree. You feel that you'd like to engage him in earnest intellectual
debate as to the existentialist implication of you breaking his nose and driving
the cartilage into his brain with your fist.

A tortured writer sits here, clasping his forehead.

The archetypal dramatic personae, Grieb wrestles earnestly with issues of
enormous moral weight and consequence... either that or he's a overconfident,
under qualified hackneyed buffoon who wouldn't know a plot or a motive if it
came up and bit him on the butt. So absorbed in his personal world of melancholy
and torment is he that he seems to have scarcely registered your presence.

"Vampyre Dove"

 Dove Wings
 Blood
 I feed by night,
 I rest by day,
 I hate the light,
 As the fables say,
 I try not to kill,
 I try not to die,
 But my fate is sealed,
 So every night I must lie,
 I lie to those I love,
 Those who share my dark embrace,
 Soon the truth will take flight,
 As on the wings of a dove

-Augus the Vampyre Poet.

You stand in a dark corridor that stretches away to the north and west. Behind
you to the south lies an imposing steel door which creaks eerily on its hinges.

The room is littered with unfinished statues, abandoned in various states of
completion. You can't imagine why they would have been left unfinished for you
detect no flaws in their construction; in fact they seem to be masterworks of
some calibre.

An iron door lies in the northeast corner of the room.

Inside a coffin~
The coffin appears much larger on the inside than the out, doubtlessly some foul
vampyre magik at work. It is dark and quiet here and the walls covered in padded
velvet convince you this would make for very comfortable sleeping quarters.

A concrete bunker~
This room shows a strong minimalist influence. It is a simple 10' * 10' * 10'
concrete cube with no adornment of any surface. An iron box lies in the room's
exact center on a marble pillar. Its lid is open.
