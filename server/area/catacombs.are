a Blood Reaper~
The Flesh Reaper snarls and salivates as it senses your blood.

The Blood Reaper appears to be a race of humanoids whose main diet is blood. Although,
apparently originating from human stock, this is where the similarity ends. Their
eyes are pale and slitted, their skin pink-white, and their jaw has rows of small
fangs with long canines. Their claws are covered with dried blood.

This long room is similar to the grand hall but it displays a more recent period
of time in great detail.  In fact, just the most recent decades are immortalised
in paint, plaster and stone.  The story tells of dark times - evil sorcerers of
great power greedily conquering the surrounding lands and then rendering them
morbid in arguments in their petty affairs.

secure the top levels.  There is still more than meets eye here, however.  You
read of a great rift in space and time being held in stasis, and the warping
effect it has had on the building.

The final chapter tells of the hero, Daeron.  His fabled deeds led to the
collapse of the Sorcerer King's empire and the rising of the masses under his
banner and shield.  Evil forces plotted to slay him, but the walls depict that
he returned from the dead to finally vanquish the evil Lich Lord, Kharneth Dhar
to another dimension. Northwards the story continues.

Daeron was finally betrayed by his younger brother and slain.  The forces of
evil were desperate to be rid of him for eternity so the plot was hatched to
spread all traces of his existence far and wide.  His body and items were
scattered across the land. The mural ends on a strange picture - depicting the
rise of Daeron from the dead to remove evil from the land forever.

A small tunnel~
This tunnel is barely wide enough for you to fit into it and appears to carry on
forever into the darkness.

The Laboratory~
The tunnel ends, here, in what appears to be a small laboratory.  There is a
large work desk in the middle of this room covered with pipes, tubes, beakers,
flasks, burners and other alchemy paraphernalia.  There is a small cabinet on
one wall that appears to hold bottles and flasks.

A dark corridor~
The corridor ends here with a door in the north wall. Above you you see a ledge
where the wall does not reach the high roof. From the ledge you hear hushed
voices but cannot make out the words.

The Archwizard's Study~
This large but lavishly-furnished room has all the essential items needed for
study.  A large fire roars in the hearth, large glowing globes cast a brilliant
illumination over the room and there is what must be the biggest reading desk
you have ever seen!  The walls are lined with neatly stacked shelves containing
maps, tomes and scrolls of all nature and description.

The Privy~
You are inside the private latrine of the higher-ranking priests of Mrinthas.
However, this one appears not to have been used for some time, as there is a layer
of dust coating everything and a total absence of any smell.

an ebony desk and well-padded leather armchair is to your right. A fire burns in

The Throne room of Kharneth-Dhar.~
This room is massive. The walls appear to be red-veined, black marble and
the pillars that fiull the room appear constructed of the same material. 
A rich, blood-red carpet leads to Kharneth-Dhar's throne. Behind Khaneth-Dhar's 
throne is a large tapestry depicting the Temple of Mrinthas, made from the 
same stone as the walls, surrounded by hideous creatures under a blood-red sky.
