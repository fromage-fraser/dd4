101 ZYKLORINSTALL~
Alright then , here are a few things that need explaining..
Firstly, this are is not your typical area, instead it is broken into 5
separate areas. There is a main part ( the tower ), and 4 portals ( earth,
air, water and fire ). The 4 portals are scattered around the mud ( I will
give details later ). The location to these portals will be found out as the
player explores the tower. The keys to these portals will be guarded by
Zyklor himself. So once defeating Zyklor, the player gains the 4 keys, and
enter the 4 portals. Each portal contains one part of a sword. Note Zyklor
himself is level 107. Each portal is guarded by a myriad of mobs up to
level 100, so the sword is quite powerful. I would suggest once a player
has found all 4 parts of the sword. that they approach an Imm, who will
oload the sword to the player. Thus you could have a limit to the number of
the swords OR this area could be a test for Hero's ( a hero-only area? ).
On each part of the sword, I will leave info as to what the player should
do ie contact an imm to see about combining the 4 parts into 1. I hope
this is self explanatory. - Matt
For vnum info see HELP ZYKLORVNUMS.

-1 POWERMONGER~
Congratulations Adventurer!!!!
You have found the 4 parts of the ONE.
At this point, you will need to approach an Imm so they can load the
completed sword for you to use.
Tell your imm to see help POWERQUEST.
Use the power of the ONE wisely, for it shapes your future.....
~

101 POWERQUEST~
If you are reading this, then a player must have instructed you to do so.
The player has just finished Zyklor ( the quest for the one ).
The player _should_ have 4 parts to the ONE ( a sword ).
Upon giving the 4 parts of the sword to you, you will have to load the
completed sword for the player (oload 14624).
Thanks
Matt

        manage to find it. Please?"

However, you will need to get through his infamous black maze. Even though
surrounded by evil, there lies somewhere deep in the earth below this castle
a feeling of good. In there I believe you find information to get through
his black maze"

ancient druids from the four elements that make up this world, namely earth,
fire, air and water. The druids created this sword for their greatest champion
Aricton. The sword however became of interest to evil, and many attacks were
made to recover it. The 4 druids sensing this danger, decided to split the
sword into four parts and banish them to the four elements of this world.
Zyklor's father was a servant to one of the druid. Zyklor heard of the legend
of the sword and vowed to make it his. I believe he is close to recovering
the sword. You must stop him and recover the sword so it is safe.

parts of the One. He has managed to acquire the 4 keys that will unlock the
portals that lead to the sword. Myself and other brave adventurers came here
to try and recover the keys so that they could be destroyed. It is up to you
to recover the keys from the evil Warlock. It is rumoured that the dark
warlock has used his great power to discover the art of transforming. Some
have seen a great dragon fly from the top of this tower. Whether it be him is
not clear. But use caution when fighting him.

above Midgaard, in mid-air, the other below Midgaard in the sewers. The third
is deep in the fiery pit that is Hell. That is all I know, may this knowledge

statue dragon black~
the statue~
A mighty statue of a black dragon towers over you.
~
The statue is of exquisite detail. Each scale is well defined on its massive
black body. Its gaping jaw is open and smoke rises from its nostrils.
Although great detail has gone into this statue, you feel great evil emanate
from it. As you stand there admiring it, you think you see its head move. You
look away, as you return to face the statue, you find it no longer on its
pedestal, but right beside you, breathing down your neck.

tongue. It appears this is some sort of dragon-man cross, and looks extremely
nasty.

On the Lake~
Your boat floats quite well on this thick green sludge. Any thicker and you
would be able to walk on the lake. The noise of falling water, or sludge,
emanates from the north. You can row to shore to the east or south.

The riddlers room~
As with the other rooms of the riddlers, this one is painted in a myriad of
colours, that start to give you a headache. Various statues line the shelf to
the north, and books, tomes and scroll lie scattered across a desk to the west.
The inhabitant jumps to his feet when you enter, and then starts an incessant
