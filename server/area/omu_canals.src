The hideous sea hag patrols the waters, her presence a warning to all who
venture so deep. With skin as rough as barnacles and eyes that gleam with malice,
she moves with purpose, searching for victims. Her rank, matted hair flows like
dead seaweed in the current, and her gnarled hands clutch at the empty space
before her, ready to clutch, stab, and strangle.

The tattoo, meticulously cut from the skin of a kopru, is more than a tattoo;
it's a talisman, believed to bestow upon its bearer some of the kopru's feared
combat ability.

The sahuagin has had a stake inserted into his rectum and has been left, while
probably still alive, to slowly die as the stake worked his way right through

gore.  Grung sure do like to send a message.
