          ********  WARNING  ********
This area is not for level grubbers.  It can be very
dangerous, and you could die, and even loose your
corpse.  It was designed to be a challenging area
with many secrets and some cool EQ, but if you plan
on an easy ride forget it, it's not here.

The Chamber of the High Priestess~
You have entered the Bed Chamber of the High Priestess.  Now you're in
trouble.  The high priestess is rumored to fornicate with Dragons,
some even say that she is half Dragon herself... but a half Dragons and
Dragons in Midgaard? Impossible.

Chamber of the Wyrmling~
You have discovered what the Cult was hiding, and if the Black Dragon
Wyrmling didn't "tell" you himself, the gnawed bones and large piles
of Dragon defication should.  And they were intending on feeding another
virgin to this horrible creature.  You shudder to think what this
Wyrmling will be like if it ever grows up.  The only exit is to the South.

This room is filled with chairs, coffee tables and magazines.  You may
sit and rest here until your appointment.  The office has a number of
sales represenatives that can help you, provided you made an
appointment.  You did make an appointment didn't you?
The tourist office is to the east and you see the main offices to the north.

Entranceway to the Main Office~
As you enter this place you feel it gets stranger and stranger.
People are running around in odd clothes, moving papers from one place to
another.  There is a shrill ringing sound, and then they pick up these
things and put it up to their ears and mouths.  This sort of place is
not meant to exist.

room... it does not look like there is any way out so you may as well lie down
on the rug that covers the floor.

A hallway in the office~
This is a pretty normal place in an odd sort of way.  The
craftsmanship seems incredible compared to the Inns you've been to in
the past, but all in all it is a very ordinary building.  There is a
picture on the wall.  Exits are South, back to the main part of the
office, and there is a glass wall and open door to the west... there
is some lettering in the glass.

Gale's office is very neat and organized, almost to the point of
obsessive.  It seems that she runs the organization just as well as
she runs her own office.  Gale is the backbone behind the business
side of the orginization.  The employee's don't even bother with Fred,
the boss, they just come here.  There is a desk here with some papers
on it and some certificates on the wall. The only way out is back to the east.

What a mess!  Fred's office is the epitome of disarray.  There a
papers, cigar butt's, and other random junk everywhere.  Its amazing that
anything ever gets done in here, or maybe not so, because nothing ever really
does get done in here.  A huge desk is in the middle of the room, and the
only way out is south.

This is an area where the employees try to work, on the various desks
scattered around the room.  Unfortuneately this is also a major office
intersection so they really can't concentrate that well.  Fred
observes this area from his office to the north.  The Entranceway
lies west and there is a copy room to the east.

This is a small room in which the salesman for the ummm organization

nothing in the room that will distract your attention.  Somehow you feel like a

A back hallway~
This is a hallway that people to sneak around, just in case.  It is
not used very much, except by Fred and Marie who come in here to
discuss cleaning sometimes.  Oh yeah then Bob and Marie also use this back
area too.  But never Bob and Fred oh no that would cause trouble, though Fred
wouldn't mind using this hallway with Gale, that wouldn't be bad at all, But
secretly Gale wants to use the hallway with Bob, but Bob doesn't know this and
spends his time in here with Marie, wishing that Marie looked like Cindy (no
there is no Cindy in this area). Oh well maybe this hallway is used alot.

contains a copy machine, that seems to produce an aura of office supply awe.
There are all sorts of nifty office supplies here, there is a desk in the

office is west, the break room is north, and there is a door to the east.

Something about this place is not right.  There is great danger below,
and to continue further downward would be like flirting with death.  There
is the stench of human flesh that rises into your nostrils, making you
ill.  Whatever is downward, is not going to like your presence.  You can go
up and down, though to go down you'd have to be a fool.
