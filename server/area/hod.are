-1 HOD HOD 'HINTERLAND OF DOLE'~
Like the ascii art? Hate it? Don't look at me, I didn't do them. :)
All due credit to those that did.

A tip on the area:
Do not put anything marked "{W({xThat you should {RKEEP!!!{W){x"
in a container. Just keep them in your inventory for a bit. You'll
run into problems if you don't.

The temple runs on, as do the signs that there's a battle taking place or has
recently done so. You don't hear the sound of fighting at the moment so maybe
it's over. For now.

Well, this explains the items. Apparently some sort of God-like being has
taken up residence in this part of the temple and he's interested in Trade.
The logic of him being a God-like being wanting to trade items and him
choosing to do so here escapes you. It must be one of those things mere

You focus your attention on the floor and suddenly a door of some kind
seems to snap into existence. Tugging on the door you discover it seems
to be connected to the surrounding room and giving it a mighty thump
further reveals it's connected to things in previous rooms, as things
in said previous rooms rattle and shift. It's going to take some kind
of detailed blueprint or some such to unlock this door...
