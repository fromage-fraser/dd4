interest:

"4.12  The war is going very badly.  Although the major outposts of the
       serpents have been destroyed, our armies are decimated and we can
       still not locate their central nest.  Maggard has asked that Aesthesiel
       be summoned for his counsel at once, now that the King has been executed
       and all the wizards released from prison."

"11.7  Mord Maggard is worried that the Queen will use the bodies of the
       3rd battalion for further transformations.  Aesthesiel has completed
       preparations for raising the seal at the great door to the hive, but
       has asked for the protection of the 5th under Gurjief.  Mord realises
       that this will be the last chance he has to secure victory."

The Serpent's Jaws~
A gigantic snake's head pushes through the ground of the clearing, its stone
jaws open wide, and two fangs bearing down and piercing the earth.  Its mouth
is hollow, and serves as some sort of doorway.  The doorway, however, has
almost been sealed: stone rubble spills from inside the head of the snake and
out onto the grass.  There is a small gap between the roof of the mouth and
the rubble, large enough for you to squeeze through.  The serpent's dull eyes
watch you as you consider your next move.

blue light.  A large seal has been painted on the tiles, and is surrounded
with more writing.  The air becomes charged with static as the seal glows then
fades, and you feel a distant rumbling.  Ornate doors lead west and east from

uneasily.  The metal is covered in writing, most of which is unreadable and
very likely magical intonements and spells.  Several figures are engraved in
the panels, including an armoured human woman weilding two swords and fighting
a gigantic humanoid serpent, and a stout demihuman opposed to a horde of flying
dragons.  "Mord Protect Us," cites some intricate script; "Avenger of those of
Good who have died by the Poisoned Fang," appears below.

seal tiles writing symbols~
A glowing seal dominates the floor of the chamber.  Its design is two concent-
ric circles containing scripture and unfamiliar symbols.  A square touches the
inner circle at each of its corners and contains further symbols.  The seal
throbs and emanates an energy that charges the air of the room, and you begin
to develop a firm headache.  The power of the seal fills you with awe and an
involuntary fear - you have the urge to flee, to escape the dark chamber.
"Death to those who Desecrate the Holy Seal," reads some script.  "Only the
Power of the Seal may keep the Serpent at Bay."

Air Vents~
A wave of heat swamps you as you enter the room, which is more accurately a
roughly hewn cavern.  Huge pipes stretch from wall to wall, or disappear into
the ground.  Several large vents open up in the ground near the west wall.
One in particular is quite large, large enough for you to climb down it if you
wished too.  The waves of heat and occassional bursts of flames that arrive
from the opening of these vents indicate that if you were inclined to enter
these holes, you might not be alive long enough to get out of them again...

Swamp~
You sink into a fetid marsh as the ripe smell of rot rises from below you.
This large chamber has been converted into an indoor swamp - the floor is
completely covered in thick, stinking mud, and all manner of swamp plants grow
in isolated clumps.  Open vents about a foot from the surface of the bog allow
warm water to trickle in, and let steam escape into the air, which is moist
and very warm.  Large palms and mangroves grow to the west of this chamber
behind a wide, low arch that bisects the room.  A door to the east will take
you back to dry land.

Baths~
The walls and floor of this room are covered in small granite tiles.  Moist
air rolls out of several vents near to ceiling; the room is hot and humid. A
large empty pool swallows most of the floor, the tiny drain holes rusted and
the surface of the bath stained.  Archways open north and east.

Apparition~
As you move through this antechamber a pinpoint of intense blue light develops
to the north.  It grows suddenly and blazes - you cover your eyes as the light
becomes stronger and stronger.  When it dies down, the flickering blue form
of a robed maiden floats above you.  The woman is unbelievably beautiful, her
clothes exquisitely emboidered.  She speaks to your mind.  "I can not stay
long my friend, the power of the queen is too great, and many of the other
gods refuse to interfere."  She seems distracted momentarily.  "However, I
must warn you - you are in great peril.  You have refused to heed the warnings
set by wiser and braver men who sealed this place thousands of years before."
A great rumbling rocks the room, and you hear crashing from the north.  The
maiden continues, "Kahsis lies directly ahead.  She will crush you, her power
is too great.  Recall now - save your soul!"  Her voice becomes sterner as her
form begins to waver and fade.  "Save yourself, I beg you!  You can never
defeat the queen, never!"  Then she is gone, and you are badly shaken.  The
noise from ahead softens then stops.  Faint laughter echos through the air,
and seems to invade your mind.  A darkened archway rears to the north.

Crash!~
An almighty crash rings out as rubble pours from the roof behind you - you are
sealed in!  A wide arch opens north, through which you see a wide dias.  A slim
woman lounges on a luxuriant thone, several courtiers about her.  She calls out
to you: "Welcome, I have been waiting for ssso long to meet you!"  Her voice
is radiant and musical, and her gaze pierces you even from a great distance.
"I have much to thank you for," she continues.  "I have been asssleep for many
yearsss, more yearsss than I can bear to remember..."  She laughs cruelly.
A clear voice fills your mind.  "Quickly!  I can still rescue you - recall to
safety!  The queen's magic is too great from here onwards - we could not rescue
you if you pray for help.  Quickly," she pleads, "she is forcing me away..."

Lair of the Queen~
You step into the throne room.  Kahsis lounges naked before you, surrounded by
her royal guards.  Her slitted eyes pierce your innards.  "Foolsss," she roars,
her voice now rumbling and deep.  She stands up.  "I WILL DESTROY YOU."  She
snickers as crackling light begins to stream from her finger tips.

Treasure Room~
You burst into a small room with golden walls.  Coins litter the floor; many
guilded chests sit open, overflowing with treasures.  You quickly take what you
can, as the complex begins to rumble and heave, tremendous noises coming from
the throne room.  Above the din you hear a piercing, tormented scream.  A dark
portal flickers with light to the west, the ancient gateway crackling into
activity.

Through the Gate~
You flee westwards through the opening gate, which then seals behind you.
The ground heaves violently as you emerge into a narrow cavern.  Soil and
rocks pour from cracks in the roof as the earth twists and bellows.

The Last Stand~
Daylight streams from above you - you have almost escaped!  As you scramble up
the rocky passage, the exit from the collapsing city is blocked suddenly by a
huge serpent.  The Queen has returned.  She screeches at you; you can no longer
understand what she is saying.  An unholy fire lights her tortured eyes, green
blood pouring from large open wounds in her body.

Sunny Field~
You scramble out of the ground and onto a sunny field of grass.  A huge cloud
of dust and rubble escapes from the hole before it finally collapses in on
itself.  You lay exhausted in the warm sun, and thank the gods that you have
survived.  A brilliant light blazes in the sky above you, and the ghostly
outline of the maiden and a stout dwarven warrior stand before you.  You
scramble to your feet.  The maiden cries tears of joy, and reaches forward to
kiss your cheek and hug you.  Her very presence refreshes you and you feel fit
and well.  The dwarf's eyes glow, and he grins widely.  He bows before you.
"You have earned a place in heaven, my friend," he says.  Mord Maggard wipes
a tear from his eye, and seems embarassed.  "You have achieved what a whole
army could not... may Kahsis never escape from hell again. Finally now, my
brothers and I may rest, rest knowing that this evil has been vanquished."  He
stands before you and kneels, offering you his great axe.  "I pray that the
gods may protect you forever more.  You are truly a hero."  The maiden places
a hand on Mord's shoulder and waves.  "Goodbye, my friend," she beams, as they
slowly fade.  You kneel on the ground, and pray for the gods to take you home.
You have earned their respect, Hero of Kahsis, and the immortals scramble to
your call.  The earth now trembles with your approach... and rightly so.

Roasted and Toasted~
Panic-stricken you attempt to clamber up the shaft, but the fireball is too
fast and it quickly envelopes you: with your flesh on fire you fall from the
rock face screaming.  Fortunately the intense agony is short lived, as you are
vapourised in a pool of molten rock at the bottom of the vent.  Perhaps in
your next life, you will behave with a little more common sense.
