100 smuggler_area~
This little file is mainly to describe what the area is about and how it all
works. There are (will) be two parts, the smugglers ship and the base
in the caves under the cliff face.

I have used the descriptions to hint to players what is coming up and a little
bit to the nature of the ship with the hints about what the ship is doing
there so far away from settlements etc... but they may or may not pick up
on these. The purpose of these hints is to get the players to board the ship
from behind by climbing up the anchor rather than foolishly boarding from in
front where they will be seen by the pirates.

The wandering mobs are there to make sleeping on the ship a little more risky
but there are only 4 of them.~

100 smuggler_cast~
The names and numbers of all the mobs in this area is as follows. Note that
the mob is unique unless otherwise stated.


The Captain "Snake Eyes"
Punjak the ships Mage
Egor the first mate
Harvy the Bosun
One Eye the look out
Serge the helmsman
Rolf the cook
Arnold a senior crewman
Arthur a senior crewman
Wandering crewmen (4)
Sleeping crewmen (3)
Sailors (4)
Bucaneers (2)
Gamblers (3)
Captians Concubine
Bodyguard

There are only 4 mobs that wander - and you'll never guess which ones ;-) The
rest are all meant to be in their respective places to tie in with the room
description. All are armed which makes the area dangerous in that respect but
only Punjak and the concubine have spells.

Captain Snake-eyes~
Captain Snake-Eyes stands arrogantly here.
~
Snake-eyes is a tall black haired man in his early thirties. He has the rough
look of one who has spent their life at sea with tanned, weathered looking
skin. His features are noble and handsome in a rugged sort of a way, you guess
he is a bastard or poor nobleman.

The Crew number some twenty rough looking men and they come at you from all
sides.  They are using an assortment of weapons, mainly sabres and knives
which, as you can relate to, are all sharp and of high quality. Perhaps it
would be a good idea in later life to not attack the crew all at once....

Arthur is the most unlikely looking sailor you have ever seen. His hands are
smooth, evidence that he doesn't do much hard work hauling cargo about. He
looks lean and not all that strong but you sense that he has a power about him
that makes other crewmen obey his orders.

A game Trail~
The trail winds slowly through the bush here. On both sides of the trial the
forest thickens and in the distance you catch the faint smell of salt water
in the air. The trail continues to the east and west.

Sand Dunes~
You walk among the sand dunes using tussock grass for hand grips as you
struggle to climb the steep hills. Looking around you notice that for a
place so close to the sea there is very little noise from wild life and sea
birds.

Cliff Face~
After a long struggle through the sand dunes you finally come out onto
a grassy bank. Carefully moving along it, you come to the edge and look
over; its a goodly way down. As you look out you can see a ship rocking gently
at anchorage. You wonder why a ship would be here, there are no towns
about for quite some distance.

You struggle up and down the dunes for a little while but you don't seem to
be getting anywhere in a hurry. Further to the south you can see the
forest once more but its hard work slugging through these dunes and you think
it might be best not to head that way. You can head back towards the trial to
the north or head off towards the beach to the east.

The Beach~
You slide down the last dune to arrive in an undignified sort of way on the
beach. Its a nice beach though, smooth sand, quite sheltered, a nice spot
for a bit of sun bathing and a few quiet ones. To the north the beach
continues but the way is blocked by a build up of timber and other sea
debris. Looking past it you think you can just make out a ship but when you
look closer you cant see anything, guess you must have imagined it since
there's no reason for a ship to be out here is there?

The Beach~
After a struggle you finally crest the last sand dune and look over the sea.
Its a picturesque view from here, smooth white sand, the sun shining brightly
and not a breath of wind. As you stand admiring the view, you trip over your
own feet and fall down the bank and land in a heap at the bottom, more than
a bit embarrassed! You quickly look around to check that no one saw anything,
luckily there's no one about. But in the distance you thought you heard
laughter quickly stifled. The beach continues to the north and
the sea looks inviting enough for a quick dip.

A rocky wall~
Strolling along the beach you soak up a few rays and do some work on your
tan. After a few minutes you arrive at a rocky bank. Looking up, you can
see that the rocks go up for quite a goodly way, probably not a good idea to
try climbing them just in case you slip. In front of you the rocks head
out to sea and then curve around the rock face. They look a bit slippery but
you think you could climb them without too much difficulty if your careful.

The Sea~
You slowly wade out into the water. Its quite warm nice and with little
wind and plenty of sun you relax and swim about for a while and soak up
some rays. Looking about, the water looks a bit more choppy to the south
and not nearly as pleasant as here. To the north the water looks as good as it
is here, you cant see anything to the east further out to sea so decide
it would be best to stay close to the shore for the meantime just in case
there's a rip.

there are a few seagulls out here and a few more heading in shore. You are
about half way along the peninsula at this point and you can probably make
it all the way without too much difficulty.

End of the Peninsula~
You have made it almost to the end of the peninsula when you look about
and realise that its getting a lot colder. With all your concentration going
on where you where going you didn't notice that its getting really windy now
and it looks like a storm is brewing. Looking back towards the beach you
realise that the tide is rising very quickly and you aren't going to be
able to make it all the way back before the storm hits. But wait in the
distance
you can see a ship, maybe its there to wait out the storm. Its not that far
out you could probably swim out to it. Alternatively you could keep moving
along
the peninsula and see where it leads and hope that there is some shelter
about.

Cold Sea~
Brrrr! The water is icy when you hit and pretty choppy. You can hardly make
out the ship in the distance its just a patch of black in the storm. Hang on,
you see a light flash once, then again and then once more. Its hard to tell if
the ships signal to something, perhaps they saw you and are trying to
guide you in. You can make straight for the ship by swimming to the north
or you could head out to sea further before heading towards it. You don't
think that you will be able to make it back to the rocks, the sea is dashing
against them firmly and you don't feel like getting squashed today.

now, you can turn north and come at it from behind. Your arms are
starting to feel the strain of the swim and your muscles are getting sore

Behind the Ship~
You finally make it to the ship and rest against the hull. The storm is
raging fully now and you think its a good idea to get aboard as quick
as you can. Up close to the ship you notice that it is built for speed
and only has a small cargo hold. You can hear voices above calling
out occasionally. Strangely there are no rungs up the side of the ship
to board her and something warns you that calling out might not
be a good idea. You can climb up the anchor to have a closer look.

The Top of the Anchor~
You strain and haul yourself up the length of the anchor. Resting weary
muscles, you look out across the ship. The deck is almost devoid of people
but there are two men leaning against the rail looking towards shore. One
of them has a lantern that he is using to make the flashes. Its then that
you realise that there is an answering flash coming from shore. Looks
like some communication is going on here, but what is this all about?
You can hop over the rail and climb onto the main deck from here.

Clinging to the Rocks~
You ease your way along the rocks being careful not to slip into the
water. As you move along you see a flash of light about 50 metres in
front of you. Pressing yourself against the rock to avoid being seen you
wonder what is out there?
You can see that there's no way forward as the rocks are already almost
covered by the tide and with the strong wind climbing would be dangerous.
You are beginning to feel a little bit desperate as your options run out.

casks of what look like wine or perhaps ale. There is also a door to the

short swords with the occasional heavier weapon. They also contain a selection
of ranged weapons both cross bows and bows. Lastly you come across a
dozen ballista bolts and some barrels of what you guess is some sort of
explosive liquid possibly pitch. A large door opens to the east and a small

there are stairs leading down to the main deck as well.

The Poop Deck~
You stand in the centre of the poop deck. Looking around you cant see
anyone, but it is dark and its difficult to see in the rain. To the south
you can see the helm and a man standing by it. Stairs also lead down to the
main deck.

Up the Mast~
You cling to the rope ladder tightly as you are thrown roughly about in the
wind! The crows nest is another few metres you think you can make it without
being blown off.

The Crows Nest~
You haul yourself over the edge of the crows nest. You think you should
be able to get a good view of the ship from here. You are about to
collapse in exhaustion but before you do a wicked sabre comes whistling
towards you!

ship over boat~
Looking over the ship, you can make out an approximate layout. Below
you and to the east lies the poop deck and the helm. To the west lies the
forecastle and the prow of the ship. You can see the longboat being loaded
just to the north of the mast. You can see several doors leading under
the forecastle and the poop deck.~

The Cargo Hold~
You slide down the last few rungs to land in the main cargo deck. You can see
a large number of silk bolts stacked against the southern wall. On the
northern
wall, casks of wine are stacked neatly. Beside the wine casks are a number
of large caskets, sealed very tightly. There are three men here carrying
wine casks and getting them ready to transport up to the main deck. The
men appear to pre-occupied with their duties to notice you. To the west
you can see a small curtained off section.

cloth bolts~
Looking at the cloth bolts you make a ball park guess at there being about
fifty bolts all up, most are about 1-2 metres in length.

wine casks winecasks~
The wine casks are all sealed tightly and stacked neatly. You judge
there are about thirty to forty stacked here.

Gamblers Quarters~
You pull aside the curtain to reveal a small living area. There are three
beds and a small table here. Seated at the table are three men playing cards,
they rise as you enter and move towards you. You hear the floor creak as they
come towards you, perhaps this area of the boat is not safe in more ways than
one.

The floor looks safe but looking carefully it seems one of the floorboards

Punjaks Quarters~
The door opens into a lavishly furnished room of roughly thirty five feet
in length. A large bed takes up most of the eastern wall and next to
it is a ornate bedside table. On the northern wall is a large bookcase
and shelving unit. On the southern wall is large desk unit with many
containers and books stacked neatly. Sitting at the desk is thin man. With
an arrogant raise of his eyebrows he enquires what you are doing in his
quarters.
To the south is a door leading to the twin of this cabin.

A Hidden Chamber!~
You slide the wall aside to reveal a weapons cache! There are stacks of
spears and javelins which on inspection appear to be of very high quality.
All are polished and have a faint odour of oil, a bit like oil used on things
that are going to be kept underwater. There are also a stack of shields, all
wrapped individually and emitting the same odour. Finally there is a large
collection of swords all with there blades wrapped to keep them quiet.

swords~
Looking at the swords you can see they are also of high quality. A rough
estimate tells you there are about thirty of them.
~
E
spears~
Looking at the spears  you estimate there are about thirty. A quick test
shows they are very sharp indeed but also very light with broad heads as
if they aren't made for throwing.
~
E
javelins javelin~
Looking at the javelins you see that they in fact aren't covered in the
same oil as the spears and swords. They are fairly heavy with longish
blades on them and you think that a human or elf would have some trouble
throwing one.
~
E
shields~
The shields are all strong metal, and all are coated in oil. All up you
guess there are going on fifty or perhaps sixty of them.

In a tight spot~
Having dealt easily with the three toughs who waylaid you as you got on board,
you move carefully towards the sound of the rest of the crew. You can hear
shouted orders and the sounds of many men rushing to get arms ready for an
attack. Suddenly the crew come into view, there must be at least twenty of
them and they are all coming for you!! Quickly looking round you see a small
rowboat which you could use to make your escape. Looking west towards the crew, if
today is a good day to die you could rush them and take a few with you!

Facing the Crew!~
You stand before the assembled crew, they don't look happy... Boldly striding
forth you easily cut down the first couple as they come towards you but then
the rest arrive and the battle royal is joined. As they slash at you, you
consider the wisdom of your choice to encounter the ship head on rather
than scoping out the situation first....

Escape!~
With a running jump you hurl yourself into the rowboat, seconds ahead of the
crew. Your weight causes the ropes holding the rowboat to snap and the
rowboat drops violently into the sea. You land with a crash, your head
bouncing nicely off the wooden seat scrambling your brain nicely. You fumble
for the oars, wiping away water and blood from your eyes, and finally manage
to start rowing towards shore.

On the beach~
You manage to row to shore after a tough struggle against the force of
nature. Wearily you haul yourself out of the rowboat and stagger onto the
shore. You lie exhausted on the shore for some moments thinking over your
experience against the smugglers ship.
