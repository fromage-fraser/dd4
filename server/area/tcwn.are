THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF ANON-

Although the races of Anon now mingle in relative harmony, each of them still
has their own separate states, most of these semi-independent city states.
The major states of each race are listed in the relevant chapters. Type read
Human, Elf, Dwarf, and Dryad to read the
organisation of the relevant races.
~
E
Human~
By far the most populous of the races, the Humans naturally have several
states. These are-

THE CITY OF ANON                           NEW THALOS
THE CITY OF FREEPORT                       THE CITY OF OFCOL
THE CITY OF SOLACE
THE CITY OF MIDGAARD                       WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE


For more information, type READ SOLACE, READ OFCOL, etc.
~
E
Anon~
THE CITY OF ANON- The most powerful of the Human states, the city
is headed by the Castellan who is appointed by the Baron from a list of
candidates nominated by the citizens of the Barony. This position is
extremely important, as the Castellan is responsible for the defense and
well-being of the city, and reports only to the Baron, who spends most of
his time on his country estate to the north of the city.
~
E
Freeport~
THE CITY OF FREEPORT- A semi-democratic state- this port is a major trade
center, and controls a large portion of the Sea of Anon. The city is
responsible for maintaining order in this pirate-ridden region, a task it
isn't always very good at. The city is ruled by a council comprised of the
Admirals and chief merchants of the city, who are elected by members of
their respective followers- the navy and the powerful merchants' guild.
Corruption is rife in this organisation, with powerful pirate lords paying off
prominent members in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
~
E
Midgaard~
THE CITY OF MIDGAARD- The oldest city on the continent, the city of Midgaard
took its name for the native name of their home world, which they abandoned
in favor of Anon centuries ago. It is a nominal democracy, with the city
being ruled by elected officials such as the mayor and the constable. The
city was once powerful, but sustained serious losses in the kinstrife wars
and now has little control outside the bounds of the city.
~
E
Solace~
THE CITY OF SOLACE- The territory of Solace covers both the city and the
surrounding lands, including Crystalmir Lake. The city is ruled by elected
officials, and a powerful military. The city has little to do with other
states, preferring to remain neutral.
~
E
Ofcol~
THE CITY OF OFCOL- The City of Ofcol rules over a large portion of the
northlands, bordering on the Dwarven Kingdoms. It is a theocracy, ruled by
an elite benevolent priesthood and its holy warriors. The people of Ofcol
are somewhat xenophobic, and have little to do with other races. The city
was constructed on the ruins of an ancient city populated by an unknown race,
and it is rumored relics from this age can still be found.
~
E
Thalos~
NEW THALOS- New Thalos is what remains of Old Thalos, the most powerful
state of Anon's distant past. It has become overrun by dangerous monsters
such as the once-tame lamia pets of the ancient Thalosians, and mighty
beholders. It is rumored that great treasure remains there still.
~
E
White Lotus Temple~
The Temple of the White Lotus is a small militaristic order of Monks who
have a seperate community from the rest of Anon in their own right. The
temple is actually a fortress, well-defended by elite monks and warriors.
The holdings of the temple border on those of Midgaard and Solace, at the
base of the Ringing Mountains.
~
E
Elf~
The elven race is smaller in number than the Humans, though it is almost as
powerful. Its holdings consist of-

THE VALLEY OF THE ELVES
THE CITY OF THE DROW

For more information, type READ VALLEY or READ DROW.
~
E
Valley Elves~
The Valley of the Elves is inhabited by the aggressive, xenophobic Valley
Elves, who are ruled by a small tribal-style council. Much like their
sylvan cousins, their government is nominal, controlling mainly the
organisation of scouting and warrior parties.
~
E
Drow~
The Drow, or Dark Elves, are an evil, aggressive race that live in cities
far beneath the world's surface. Only one is known by non-Drow, and it is
so secretive even its name is not known. It is ruled by several noble houses,
who are constantly battling to become First House, the house with the
most say. Women hold all the positions of political power, and control the
priesthood, which plays a vital role in Drow politics. This order answers
only to their cruel and evil demon deity Lloth.
~
E
Dwarf~
The Dwarves of Anon are concentrated in one single kingdom, a remote, little-
travelled place known simply as the Dwarven Kingdoms. Their system of
Government is clan-based, with various clan chieftains taking turns ruling
the kingdoms. The holdings of the Dwarves once extended as far south as
lost Moria and as far west as the Northlands, but that was a long time ago.
Some consider the Dwarves to be a dying race, though it is best not to say
this within earshot of any Dwarves!
~
E
Dryad~
Dryads, being nomadic, free-spirited beings, have no organised habitats or
political structure, though a small, independant community of these magical
creatures has formed in the forest west of Haon-Dor.

E
tome social history~
This tome attempts to give, in a brief outline, the social structure of
the many races of Anon. For more information on the relevant races, type
read Elf, Dwarf, Human, or Dryad.
~
E
Elf~
The Elves of Anon vary in their social structure according to the various
sub-types of Elves. This chapter will focus on those Elves known as the
High or True Elves, the Elves that deign to associate with humanity, and
have a desire for adventure.

High Elves come from a very rigid social structure, a complex feudal system
where vertical ascension is very difficult. Basically, the path an Elf will
take in life is determined to a very large extent by what their parents did-
i.e, mages are the children of magicians, warriors the children of warriors,
nobles the children of nobility, etc. Occasionally, young Elves who
demonstrate an exceptional talent for a particular area, most particuarly
the priesthood, but sometimes the Magical Arts, will be taken from their
families and raised to become a member of that order. Other than that, an
Elves fate in their very long lives is determined by their birth. While this
may seem unfair to those used to a more flexible system, the Elves have no
problem with the glass ceiling.

There is perfect sexual equality in Elven society, though in general the
males favor areas such as the warrior or magic arts, and females prefer the
priesthood or healing arts. Adventuring Elves are most commonly those
interested in the magical arts, though many also have significant martial
experience.
~
E
Dwarf~
Dwarven social structure is totally clan-based, with the social standing
of each Dwarf directly related to their clan. And while most clans have
members of many professions, certain clans favor mining and engineering,
such as the Chiselled Rune Clan, or fighting and exploration, such as the
Whirling Axe Clan.

Warriors hold the highest position in any clan, irrespective of focus. For
it is the warriors who defend the beleagured Dwarves from their many enemies.
The leader of each clan is generally the eldest and most experienced Dwarf.
Adventuring Dwarves are always warriors, as the other Dwarves, such as
healers, miners and bards, have little interest in such activities.

Female Dwarves are highly prized in Dwarven society, as they comprise only
about 20% of the race's numbers. And since Dwarves reproduce so infrequently,
they are often more guarded than even the Dwarves' precious minerals. Thus
female adventurers are much rarer than males, not due to any sexism but due
to simple numbers.
~
E
Human~
It is extremely difficult to summarise human sociology, as there are as many
types of social structures as there are independant communities of humanity.
Generally, though, humans prefer vaguely deomcratic processes (they seem
to enjoy electing their leaders), and prize the freedom of the individual
above all else, though they always knuckle under to the pressure of
authority.

Human society is very flexible, with upward and downward mobility usually
quite easy for those with enough power, money and ability. For example,
wealthy humans can buy their children places in mage or priest academies,
regardless of their offspring's aptitude, and a little money and a big stick
can allow even the lowest human to attain very high offices.

Adventuring humans are generally religous warriors, travelling worshippers of
Buddha who seek to spread the word of their god and crack a few skulls along
the way. Other humans have little desire to leave their environments, as
many still harbour old prejudices against the other races.

Sexism has been all but eliminated from Human society, after females
demonstrated during the race wars that they were just as capable of
casting spells and swinging swords as the males.
~
E
Dryad~
As Dryads rarely live together in communities it is difficult to assess
social classes or structure. Generally, all Dryads of both sexes are
considered equal. However, one can easily lose great status among fellow
Dryads by showing a lack of proper respect or love for nature.

Dryads that do live in communities usually have a central figure (always
female), who decides on the general activities of the group.
Dryads actually place a higher value on the life and well-being of flora
and fauna than they do any sentient race, including their own.

Dryad males are extremely rare, and are not often seen outside the breeding
communities Dryads form every 7 years when they are fertile. Such males are
in general inferior to the females, though this is due more to lack of
proper training and experience rathr than any inherent flaw.

primary sources by Xanafax and compiled here for the dilettante to peruse
and learn a little about their fellow Anonians. For further information,

~
E
Dryad~
Until very recently, the mysterious Dryads had lived apart from all other
races, inhabiting secret glades in the deepest forests of Anon. They lived
simple, peaceful lives, attuning themselves to the majestic forces of nature,
and drawing magical energy from them that they could turn to any usage they
wished.

The Drayds were ruled by a wise and gentle immortal named Xanibdar, who had
come with them from their home world many centuries ago, stepping through
a portal to emerge in Anon. They had fled their own world, the name of which
has been forgotten, to escape war and enslavement, and on Anon they found
peace. For a time.

War broke out between Human, Dwarf and Elf, the cause of which was considered
trivial and immaterial to the spiritual Dryads, as was the (to them) petty
war itself. Then the Humans and Dwarves stormed the once-lush forests of
Anon, in search of Elves, and many thousands of acres of woodland was turned
to barren waste in their relentless march. The Dryads grew angry, and emerged
from their hidden realm, proving their existence to startled mortals who had
previously thought them to be legend.

Using their great powers and reputation, the Dryads brought the war to a halt,
a relatively easy task as the Humans and Dwarves were then still relatively
small in numbers and weak in magical skills. They did not do so out of
sympathy for the Elves, for the Elves had scorned the Dryads when they arrived
as if they were but simple primitives living wild in the forests. They did so
to preserve what was left of their sacred woodlands.

Dryads remain reclusive however, and are rarely found in large groups.
However, they have been known to emerge on occasion when the woodlands
in which they live are threatened.
~
E
Elf~
Aeons ago, when the land of Anon first came into being, Elves were among the
first races to emerge through the mystical portals that sprang up across the
continent, and they quickly established themselves a powerful and extensive
domain. They concentrated their settlements in the dense woodlands that then
covered most of Anon, or build beautiful crystal fortresses high in the
western mountains that seperate Anon from the Desert wastes.

Centuries passed, and gradually the Elves fell from dominance, losing interest
in the pursuit of power and wealth, and instead immersing themselves in the
study of the magical arts. Generations of such research eventually resulted
in the evolution of a race of Elves of which every member possessed latent
magical talent, the ability to shape and mold the magical energies which
flowed across Anon into whatever usage pleased them.

Thus eventually the Elves became renowned mages, and kings and princes of all
races sought them for their abilities, as well as their counsel, for Elves
were counted among the wisest of all races, save the Dryad. And the Elves
prospered, and lived in relative harmony with their neighbors.

Eventually, discord began to emerge, caused as is often the case by the
jealousy of the "lesser" races, and war between Elves and the other races
broke out. Combined armies of Dwarves and Humans drove Elves from their
forests and their crystal palaces, at the cost of countless lives on both
sides, for the Elves did not surrender their lands easily.

This war raged for thirty years, until it was ended by the coming of the
Dryads, who were angered at the desecration of their beloved forests by Human
and Dwarf, and a peace was negotiated, for the mysterious dryads were greatly
respected and feared. The races returned to their domains, and have since that
day maintained an uneasy truce, though in truth many members of the warring
races still hold a deep hatred for the others. Some say the Elves' natural
arrogance and condescension to the "lesser" races brought about the war-
others say it was the natural aggression of the Dwarves and Humans. Who is
to say?
~
E
Dwarf~
Dwarves were the second race to emerge into the land of Anon, after the
Elves. They quickly grew quite fond of this land, admiring the many tall,
powerful mountain ranges which to their added delight they found were rich
with valuable minerals. Soon Dwarven mines peppered every major mountain
range on the continent, and some Dwarves had even crossed the Salt Sea to
the New World in search of new ranges to mine.

Dwarves paid little attention to the affairs of other races, save the Elves
whom they kept a suspicious eye on, and the Kender, whom they banned upon
threat of war of coming near their hoards of gems and metals. They continued
to mine and smith, digging deep into the roots of the mountains of Anon,
and discovering many wonders (and evils- the Dwarves warred long against
tribes of Goblins who shared the mountain depths).

When Humans arrived, they formed a close bond with the prosperous Dwarves,
and an enduring alliance was forged that till this day remains unbroken by
either side. And while this alliance benefited both Humans and Dwarves, it
meant catastrophe for other races.

Dwarves had long hated and feared Elves and their magical ways, for Dwarves
detest magic, and Humans had been deeply jealous of the Elves' wealth and
power. So both races made was against the Elves, and nearly succeeded in
eradicating them. It was the intervention of the Dryads, who feared the
loss of their deep forests in the war, who stopped the war, and made the
Dwarves and Humans swear an oath to never again raise arms against any other
race, or to ever again wantonly destroy the forests of Anon, as they had
done during the war.

The Dwarves agreed, and withdrew to their mountains. Gradually they succumbed
to internal strife caused by boredom and isolation, and one by one the many
Dwarven kingdoms collapsed and disappeared. Only a very few remain today, and
they are but a shadow of the mighty kingdoms of their ancestors.
~
E
Human~
Humans are a young race, compared to Elf, Dwarf and Dryad, having come to
Anon much later than them. The Humans of Anon came from many different
worlds, as refugees, wanderers, explorers or fugitives. And, as Humans are
wont to do, they quickly built towns and cities, and farmed the land, and
hunted the local animals, and they became quite comfortable in their new
home.

Kingdoms were established quickly, and just as quickly brought down by
rebellions, feuds, or war with their neighbors. Eventually a kind of stability
came into being, with individual city states (such as Anon, the largest,
and Midgaard, the first kingdom formed on Anon) establishing themselves
domains independant of each other.

Peace became even more advantageous when the Dwarves offered the hand of
friendship, and both sides soon prospered from a lucrative trade of the
Human-produced food and goods for the products of the Dwarven mines. Both
races enjoyed this situation, and soon a powerful aliance was formed.

It was never known who suggested war upon the Elves, or why it was suggested,
but it was, and both races eagerly agreed. For over thirty years, Humans
and Dwarves mercilessly assaulted the Elven kingdoms, reducing most of them
to ashes, along with much of the lush forests of eastern Anon. It was then
the Dryads stepped in, and negotiated a treaty to save their forests, and the
war was ended, though the prejudices remained.

Humans, no longer diverted by war, channeled their energies in other directions,
and begin to enhance the physical, mental and spiritual development of their
race. Academies were established far and wide to teach Humans this new school
of thought that had developed, the Martial Arts. Humans excelled at it, but
other races found it too difficult or boring, especially the Dwarves.

Now today, Humans are by far the most numerous of all races on Anon, and
also one of the most powerful, thanks to their mastery of the Martial Arts.

This book is in fine condition, except for one fact- all the maps have been
unfortunately torn out, so you'll have to go by the text descriptions. The
book is divided into four chapters- NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST. For more
information, try read north, read south etc.
~
E
NORTH~
The vast majority of the lands north of the City of Anon is dominated by
the Dark Desert, covering a vast portion of the continent. Many adventurers
have gone insane wandering in this God-forsaken realm, and little is known
about what lies beyond it.
~
E
SOUTH~
The City of Anon rests on the north shore of the Sea of Anon, also
called the Seas of the Pirate Lords because of the great number of
pirates who have divided the vast sea among them to better rob
sailing merchants of their wealth.

Beyond the sea is a mountain range separating the town of
Solace from the sea, and to the east of Solace is a broad grassy plain
leading to Kerofk and ending at the Sea of Deception.
~
E
EAST~
Across the sea east of Anon lies the forest of the Haon-Dor, home to
a den of spiders and a cave of lemmings, as well as a mystical cave
inhabited by druids and other mystical creatures. Beyond this lies
the great city of Midgaard, second in size only to Anon itself.
Further east lies the Dwarven Kingdom, as well as the caves of Moria,
and further south lies the ruined city of Thalos, and it is rumored that
a city of Drow is located near there as well.

North of Midgaard lie the plains of the north, where may be found the great
tree of Yggdrasil as well as the valley of the elves, and it is rumored
that the city of Olympus is situated at the top of a large mountain there.
Northeast lies the town of Ofcol, which is ruled by a holy order of
Dragonlords.
~
E
WEST~
To the west of Anon there is a large, grassy plain, with impassable
mountains creating a wall to the far west. At the foot of these mountains
lies the Warlock's Keep, and nearby is located Mount Doom, where daring
adventurers may find Lord Krothgar's Fortress.

Nearer to Anon and farther north is the Ghost Town, an abandoned town
taken over by undead. Farther south lies the Ginnungagap, a magical
rift that links this world and the city of Krondor in a nearby
plane of existance.

The Temple of Anon~
You are standing before the Temple of Anon, a truly majestic structure
constructed from pure marble. Tall Corinthian columns flank an impressive
set of bronze-bound oaken portals, which are never shut save in times of
trouble. Through these doors you can glimpse the majestic interior of the
Temple. Atop the pillars rests a plinth bearing an incredibly well-crafted
frieze which depicts the Immortals at work creating the world. A broad,
tree-lined avenue called "Victory Parade" runs past the Temple, and
Glory Avenue leads off to the south. A small plaque is on a pillar.

Marvelously sculpted likenesses of the Immortals line the aisle of this
sanctuary of the Gods. Tapestries on the walls depict their victories over
their enemies, and many of the treasures they acquired on such campaigns
are also displayed here. There is a magnificent altar fashioned of purest
obsidian to the north, chased with gold and partially covered with white
cloth. Behind this stands the healer, who will tell you how he can help you

up and leave if you enter. A shining white portal lies against the western wall.

Inside the Chippy~
You have entered the local chippy. Your nostrils are almsot immediately
assailed by a pleasant aroma- it's amazing how good hot fat smells, isn't
it? You see a portly man standing behind a large glass counter full of
fried food. It certainly smells a lot better than it looks. A customer
standing next to you says- "It looks a lot better than it tastes...". Most
of the food has probably been sitting under those hot lights for a couple
of hours. The only thing you can be reasonably sure of is the chips.
By the way, EVERYTHING is fried.

In here Clea, the beautiful Artificer from Ofcol, works on her
simple artifacts, which she sells to the wealthy merchants and nobles

relatively useless, and you feel no urge to buy one.

The Book Shoppe~
This old shop is filled with old wooden shelves crammed with books, the
furniture strained to breaking point by the many tomes stacked upon it. In
front of these shelves an ancient man sits reading an ancient text. As you
enter he welcomes you and offers to show you some of his stock- abridged
versions of some of the greatest works of world literature.
