Very big.  Colossally huge.  You don't seem to have any problem finding a seat.

        This tent is darkened at first.  Then it gradually lightens, although
you do not see the source of the light.  You do hear a loud breathing sound
though.  You think it may be coming from right behind you.  You think this
because you can feel very warm breath on the back of your neck.  You turn,
and see a very large, very evil looking creature.  It's a Dragon.  It opens
its mouth, but does not attack.  Instead it just laughs at you mercilessly.
The Dragon snorts a cloud of smoke at you.

right after the Circus came to town.  Wouldn't surprise me if he is the one

First Look at the Big Top~
        You receive your first good look at the Big Top.  The size of this
tent was amazing from the outside, but is even more breathtaking from the
inside.  You feel as if you are in a different world, where the sky is only
a little closer.  You see 3 Rings spread out in front of you.  A high wire
extends between poles at a dizzying height.  The 1st Ring appears to hold
a cage which contains several large lions.  The 2nd Ring is filled with clowns
who are trying to fit into a small carriage.  In the 3rd Ring, a man is
preparing to put on a blind fold, while his assistant stands against a target.
He has a rack of knives next to him.  You may enter the 2nd Ring to the south.
To the east and west are the Grand Stands, and the Entryway is to the north.

The 2nd Ring - You'd better read the description of this room. ~
        You are in the 2nd Ring.  You see a rickety carriage, which a line of
clowns are trying to squeeze into.  You've already seen many more fit into it
than could possibly fit.  The 1st Ring is to the west and the 3rd Ring is
to the east.  A ladder on a pole here provides access to the tightrope above.
To the north is the first look a visitor to the Big Top has.  You notice that
the 1st ring is a cage which contains several HUNGRY Lions.  Entering it would
be fairly suicidal.  It is a good thing it is locked!

        You are still 80 feet up in the air.  DIRECTLY below you is the Lion's
Cage.  If you survived the fall, YOU WOULD SURELY DIE when the Lions got ahold
of you.  You note that the door is closed to the cage, so you would have very
little chance of running away if you did fall into the cage.  As you take
your eyes off the ground below, you see the end of the wire immediately to

really do have a nice view, of a very long wire.  You still have a ways to go.

choices are to go back down, or try to walk the high wire to the west.  Of
course, the wire goes above the lion's cage, which has an open top.  If you
did survive the fall, you probably wouldn't feel like adventuring again.

        Please feel free to pet and play with any of the animals.  They
        are all very friendly, and never hurt the public.  Especially
        the Bear.  Feel free to enter his cage and pet him.

                                        - The Owner


Penned underneath this is a note that says:  Beware the Bear!!!

You may enter the Elephant Pen to the west, the Bear Pen to the south, or
the Horse Corral to the east.  Or you may return north.

that it is a tight fit.  The poor Midget is also the poorest paid of all the
Freaks.  But that doesn't bother him.  He has a second profession that he
practices on the side to make a little extra cash.  He also keeps a rather
large guard dog in his trailer to discourage visitors.

all the objects in the room have a slight shimmer to them.  Closer examination
reveals that the bed is a cot, the table a night stand, and the sitting room
is a chair.  It appears the Illusionist tries to fool even himself sometimes.

Binky's Kitchen~
        A rather small room really, but the aromas drifting to you make your
mouth water.  A feast fit for a king, or an immortal is spread upon the table
before you.  You feel compelled to sit and at taste some of the delicacies.
Somehow, you know that everything you find here will be very filling, yet
completely fat-free.

StrayKat's Abode~
You find yourself up to the knees in a soft, slimy mass. Wouldn't be all that
bad... but the smell and that thing wrapping itself around your ankle. The
floor somehow seems to be moving but as you look closer you realize that it
is a thick layer of feasting maggots. You frantically look for an exit but
all you see are the unclimbable, slime-coated walls of a huge.... TRASHCAN!!!

The Abyss~
You are deafened by the screams of the insane tortured souls who are utterly
condemned to suffer eternally due to their displeasing of the Gods.  Chaos is
the only predictable feature in the Abyss.  You hope and pray that you can
escape this nightmare.  You look frantically for an exit and find....
THERE ARE NONE! YOU ARE UTTERLY DAMNED!
