-1 demondium~
Welcome to the pits of Demondium!

Here lies 7 levels of evil, banished by the efforts of Absulom and Zrack.

Each level requires that you complete a task before you can proceed.

The known levels are:

Level 1: Pits of Demondium
Level 2: Mines of Demondium

It is not known what lies beyond those, as no adventurer has returned alive.~

Emptiness~
You are lost in what seems to be an infinite void.
You are surrounded by inky blackness in all
directions.  You cannot find any walls to guide
yourself by.  Exits lead in most directions.

Edge of a crevice~
You stop suddenly as one foot finds no
ground beneath it!  You seem to be on the
edge of a crevice of some sort.  Just how

Bottom of the crevice~
You tumble down the crevice!

You fall.....

and fall.....

and fall.....

and fall.....

*CRUNCH!!*

You have landed on something cold and
slimy, but soft enough to break your fall,
and until you landed on it, it was alive.
You can see a stone archway in the distance
to the west.

where souls may pass back into the world

You have finally made it to the summit of
this great harsh mountain!  The summit is
a mere 2m wide, but from here you can see
all the lands around you - and everything
looks grey, harsh and cold.  The only way
off is back down, however there now seems
to be a ward blocking your way in that
direction. This is also the last place
where you can recall ... the only other
way out lies in killing Thrasher.

Hear me stranger - do not attempt to breach
the portal.  Once it has been used by a
living creature, then all the undead hordes
lead by Thrasher will be unleashed.  Instead
your path lies in the tunnels around you.
You must visit all three tunnels to continue.
I strongly advise you to take the south tunnel
last.

Secret Chamber~
The rough tunnel ends here in a small round chamber. The chamber is very dark
and smells of death.  There is a small round sacrificial table in the center of
the room. You feel that the Gods would answer you if you prayed for transportation
from this room.

Thrasher's Altar~
You stop suddenly, shocked at where you have dared enter.  The room is circular
and huge evil magical powers race around the circumference of the circle
incessantly. Dominating the room is a round, jet black sacrificial table in its
center. Dominating the table is a being of such immense evil the sight of whom
shocks you deeply, making you unable to move.

The Demon Lord Thrasher says 'I have been watching you, peasant.'

A wide cave entrance~
You are just inside the entrance to a wide cave. The cave is just high enough
for a tall person to stand up in. The cave looks like it was dug out of the side
of the mountain, rather than having formed naturally. The walls are liberally
covered by symbols, and you notice one that seems to be repeated many times.

There is a plaque set into the wall.

to the south.  It looks too heavy to move.~
