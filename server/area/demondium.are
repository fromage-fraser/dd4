-1 demondium~
Welcome to the pits of Demondium!

Here lies 7 levels of evil, banished by the efforts of Absulom and Zrack.

Each level requires that you complete a task before you can proceed.

The known levels are:

Level 1: Pits of Demondium
Level 2: Mines of Demondium

It is not known what lies beyond those, as no adventurer has returned alive.~

the chilling grey clouds that cover all the skies.  The summit of Karem Soulhunter
is hidden in the clouds, yet it is there you feel you must go to have any hope of
escaping this place...

Windy Ledge~
The wind whips fiercely around you on this thin, unsafe looking ledge high on the
mountain. Far below you you can see the path you took from the entrance to the Netherworld.

Landslide!~
You slip and fall on the loose slate!

You tumble downwards, faster and faster!!
You land with a bang and dust and rubble
swiftly covers you.  You are right at the
bottom of Karem Soulbiter.  To the north
lies the path at the foot of the mountain.
You realise with a groan that you must
start all over again...

heading eventually towards the summit.

Entrance to the Netherworld~
You are standing on a windswept plateau in front of a vast and foreboding
mountain.  A strong gust chills you to the bone.  The mountain is Karem
Soulbiter, and this is the Netherworld.  All around you is grey, from the
many shades of grey rock, to the chilling grey clouds that cover all the
skies.  The summit of Karem Soulhunter is hidden in the clouds, yet it is
there you feel you must go to have any hope of escaping this place...

To the west you can see a small trail that you didn't notice the first
time you were here.  There is a ward blocking the entrance to the path
however.

looks grey, harsh and cold.  The only way
off is back down, however there now seems
to be a ward blocking your way in that
direction. This is also the last place
where you can recall ... the only other
way out lies in killing Thrasher.

Hear me stranger - do not attempt to breach

your path lies in the tunnels around you.
You must visit all three tunnels to continue.
I strongly advise you to take the south tunnel
last.

Escape tunnel~
You crawl on your hands and knees through
a tunnel that has obviously been dug as a
means of escaping from the Cult of Thrasher.
You wonder what they used to dig the tunnel with.

End of the Escape tunnel~
The escape tunnel ends abruptly here, although it is unclear why.  Perhaps the
escapee was caught.  You can see the digging implement used lying on the dirt floor.

Thrasher's Altar~
You stop suddenly, shocked at where you have dared enter.  The room is circular
and huge evil magical powers race around the circumference of the circle
incessantly. Dominating the room is a round, jet black sacrificial table in its
center. Dominating the table is a being of such immense evil the sight of whom
shocks you deeply, making you unable to move.

The Demon Lord Thrasher says 'I have been watching you, peasant.'

A wide cave entrance~
You are just inside the entrance to a wide cave. The cave is just high enough
for a tall person to stand up in. The cave looks like it was dug out of the side
of the mountain, rather than having formed naturally. The walls are liberally
covered by symbols, and you notice one that seems to be repeated many times.

There is a plaque set into the wall.
