On Top Of Siege Engine~
Whoa what a view, you can just about see Midgaard from here. To the west
you can see the castle walls a mere 10 ft away. The wood on the top of the
siege engine looks old and rotten.

Falling~
AAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGG   ---<<<<<<<<<>>>>SPLASH>>>>>---
That was lucky you landed in the moat. Well maybe not so lucky it's dark
green and you can feel things brushing up against your legs. The Moat
leads north and south from here.

Moat~
The Moat seems to be getting clearer here; you can almost see the bottom.
You can still feel thing brushing against you but now you can make out
dark green shapes under the water. Something is glinting at the bottom of
the moat.

Under The Drawbridge~
The water Smells even worse here and the water seems to boil and froth as
you approach. Something big lies beneath the water, the drawbridge above
looks rotten and might collapse at any moment. The moat continues to the
south.

Moat~
The water is dark brown here and the smell makes you want to vomit. A
large pipe to the west seems to be the cause of the smell, raw sewage is
pouring from the pipe. It gets worse it seems to be the only other exit.

The sewer pipe is slick and you find the footing is slippery. Rats and
other rodents scuttle away as you approach, well most of them. The pipe
continues into the castle to the west and dim light comes from the east.

Underwater Assault~
The water stings your eyes and seems to taste very salty. Dark green
shapes swim around the edges of your vision, occasionally you feel a nip
at the back of your head or legs but nothing seems to be there when you
look. Below you is the remains of a attempt to breach the castle walls, it
was not successful from the look of the bodies scattered around the bottom,
held down by the rusty armour they still wear.

a long time ago. Rusty weapons lie discarded on the ground or embedded in
some poor victim's corpse. A trench leads to the north and to the east you
can see a strange looking hill.

mound of bodies. Even now hands still poke from the mound and seem to be

The path becomes cobblestone here, its made of a strange black stone that

is a old drawbridge leading to a castle that looks as if it has been made
from the same stone and to the west lies a dark forest.

Drawbridge~
The drawbridge looks as if it should have been condemned years ago. The
Wood has rotted and the steel bands holding them are rusted and broken. As
you step onto the drawbridge some timber drops into the murky water
beneath. A Thrashing noise and a spray of moat water make you think you
should be careful. To the west lies The entrance to the castle.

Throne Room~
The floors are made of a highly polished black stone that reflects all
that is in the room. The walls are covered in Tapestries of Battles
between Silver knights and horrible red demons. The roof is lost in the
shadows beyond the torchlight, but you get the feeling something is above
watching you. The Throne is made from the same black polished stone and
covers the entire west wall.

Books cover the walls of this room, in the middle is a large stone table
on which small corpses of animals can be seen. A few books lie open to
pages about Demons and controlling them. A large pentagram made of a red
sand is on the floor and a figure in red robes is staring at it intently.

It is dark and smelly here and the water seems to grab at your legs as you
wade through it. There is a constant splashing sound coming from ahead of
you. You hope that only rats are in here.
