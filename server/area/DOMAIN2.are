The Lower Reaches~

You are standing in a small sparcely furnished room.  There is a stairway
leading up and a passage leads south. A plain looking sign attracts your
attention.

Another rather non-descript room hardly registers on your senses.

It has... yes you guessed it,  four exits.

North,  East,  West,  South.

Four exits are the best feature of this room.

North,  East,  West,  South.

Is this the same room as you left?  It must be an illusion.  Four exits
are not really there(?),  but you could try going:

North,  East,  West,  South.

The dark tunnel~

You are in a rather damp narrow tunnel leading south.  This tunnel is
rough hewn,  and appears to be older than the room you just stepped out of.
There is a magically illuminated sign on the wall.

The Glowing Grotto~

You are standing in a massive cavern.  It is lit up by millions of
glow-worms. There is a tunnel leading off to the West.

There are some stairs leading Down. There is an old decrepit sign hanging
off rusty hinges creakes loudly in a slight breeze...

The Final Test Entrance - The Choice Room~

Some where down the stairs your vision blurs and you appear in a small
room.  The air here is stale and dank,  and yet the room is

absolutely spotless. This room has three closed doors.  West,  South and
East. A plain sign hangings neatly on the North wall.

Congratulations on getting this far!

The final test is a simple test of your LUCK!

Pick one of the doors.  One is the way through - the others are a one way
trip to purgatory the hard way.

If you wish,  you may recall now and save yourself.  Otherwise,  make the
right choice and you will be rewarded (as well as seeing what is on the
other side).

May the luck of the Gods be with you.

You are standing in a large chamber.  Artifacts litter the room,  placed
rather chaotically.  The walls have magnificent tapestries depicting
ancient battles,  banners hang from a beam spanning the ceiling.
