firetongue alaghi warlock~
Firetongue~
{rFiretongue{x, Alaghi, Warlock, Leader of the {YAesir{x is standing here.
~
As you look at this Alaghi, you notice that he is not as large as the usual
members of this race, although his face is twisted into the permanent sneer
that is a trademark of these beastmen. Twin weapons hang at his sides, both
defying definition of form, but seemingly made out of darkness and shadows.
Brown-black hair covers most of his visible scar-adorned body, and black eyes
with red pupil stare out from his deep sunken eye sockets. You are just about
to dismiss him as a regular mercenary when you notice a faint tendril of fire
playing along his arm, and a small drop of acid dripping from his fist, tools
of the trade for a warlock.

The tattoo of Xuul, God of Destruction crowning his forehead looks as if it
belongs there, as if he was born with it.

Firetongue is using:

Gateway to the city~
You are standing inside the city wall that surrounds the city of
Draagdim.  Either side of the seemingly miniscule gate, the mighty
city wall, renowned throughout the lands for its steadfastness,
stands as a rampart holding the wilderness of the surroundings at bay
from the civility within.  North you smell swamp gas.

The sea breeze blows in as you open the door then the door swings
silently shut behind you as you enter the dark shop.  The meagre
light of the torches on the walls gleams off the highly polished
weapons arrayed around this room. The sound of a hammer striking
metal beats in the background.

The gates~
You stand before a massive pair of ornate, iron gates topped with
curlicues and ornate spear heads.  Instinct tells you that these
decorations are razor sharp and are designed to stop intruders from
climbing over the gates.  Beyond the gates you can see a drawbridge
leading to vast and beautiful gardens and finally the palace itself.

The drawbridge~
The drawbridge seems to be here more for effect than as a hindrance
to an attacking force.  The sides of the drawbridge are draped with
ivy and the water flowing beneath is crystal clear.  The bed of the
moat is made up of pebbles and rocks which are home to many colourful
fish.  To the north you see some beautiful gardens surrounding the
palace and to the south are the gates.

to each side with pretty fountains in the middle.  Many different
coats of arms line the walls as do tapestries and paintings of
different people, most likely past kings.  The walls of the throne
are lined with the Royal Guardsmen.  Two stairwells lead off from here
but they are heavily guarded by the Royal Guardsmen making them

The Western Docks~
You are standing at the docks which gave the Port Quarter its title.
This Quarter of the city is the only part which is truly busy all the

large containers from the huge ships.  To the north the docks carry on.
To the south is the entrance to a seedy tavern called "The Rusty Anchor".
To the west is a jetty. To the east an alleyway called "The
Links" runs down around the Rusty Anchor to the Southern Docks.

Titan Avenue~
Titan Avenue is a pleasant lane leading in a north-south direction.  Its name
however, belies a gentle, less-travelled road.  People in this area are
usually here for pleasure, not war or business.  Young couples can be seen
walking the streets here at any hour of the day or night.

Porsche fan.  As you look around, you notice some equipment left on the
ground.  Make sure you ask Sonne before you take anything.  You feel like
someone is watching you in this room at this very moment.

{rXeddicus'{W Chamber{x~
As you step into this room a tingle runs across your body and you feel dizzy
for a moment. Once the feeling passes you think it must have been what it
feels like to go insane. You can make very little sense out of anything you
see. Holes open up in the air and {Mpink{x{w bunnies run out of them onto a
desk. The desk itself is covered in grass one moment, then plain sturdy wood,
then {Mpink{x{w bunnies the next. The rabbits run into another hole as it
opens up, which is fortunate, as the whole desk bursts into {Rfla{yme{rs{x{w a
moment after they make their exit. Against what is the east wall, at the
moment anyway, is a {yglo{Ywi{x{yng{x{w surface that seems to ripple with your
movements. The west wall seems to decide it would rather be the ceiling at
this moment, as it and the former ceiling switch places as you watch and
think about gouging your eyes out. You are distracted from that thought,
though, as the floor vanishes from out beneath your feet and a sea of
{Yblinding light{x{w takes its place. Once your vision returns you notice the
floor seems to have done the same. The glow in the east wall seems to be gone
now, too. Wait- there it is on the north wall. Or maybe the east wall became
the north wall and the north wall became the east wall. It's possible you got
turned around in the flash of the floor disappearing and becoming a blinding
sea of light, too. You risk a peek at the ceiling (or is it the west wall?)
and thankfully only see a rather large {dengraving{x{w in it. At this point
you figure there's nothing left to lose, so you start taking inventory of the
various objects in the room. A moving dart board walks along the walls. Funny
that you missed that before.
(LOOK at REST or CONTINUE or MORE or SECOND HALF to see the rest of the room)

con continue rest more second half~
Perhaps it was hiding behind the preserved carcass of {RAsverna{x.{w Or
maybe it came out of one of the constantly opening and closing holes in
reality that just dumped a few dozen warring {Wballs of wool{x{w around you.
They scream horrible battle cries as you hurriedly look away. Your eye is
caught by a common looking bookshelf in the middle of the room. It contains
thankfully normal looking books. That is, they look normal until you take one
out and open it up. Oh well. There are {Rb{Ga{Br{ys{x{w of some sort lying on
the ground off to the side and...suddenly the whole room seems to
{Ybl{Wi{Ynk{x{w and everything is different. Totally different. And even more
bizarre. You do the smart thing and shut your eyes.
~
E
holes hole~
The holes spring open and close at all different paces and are of all
different sizes. Some are big enough for 2 men to walk through and open and
close in a blink, others are barely big enough to see but remain open for the
entire time you're in the room. Some of them produce life forms, some of them
spew out air, others things you don't want to think about. They provide a view
of a wide variety of things, including a purple sunset, a gremlin throwing a
soda can at something, and, worst of all, what you get the distinct impression
is the inside of {WYOU{x.
~
E
bunnies bunny~
These soft bundles of {Mpink{x joy are carrying what appear to be tubes of
chap stick and are wearing army boots. They give the desk quite a beating
briefly. You get smacked on the top of your head all of the sudden, then a
bunny plops to the ground in front of you before bounding back into the group.
~
E
desk~
The desk seems to be one of the many focal points of magical or just really
damn weird energy streaming throughout the room. It changes states of being
often and even winks at you once, you think. When it bursts into colored
flames and turns into some kind of a shape-keeping liquid are especially
intriguing moments.
~
E
glowing surface~
It isn't bright enough to make you squint, but is fairly noticeable
nonetheless. Every time you make a move the wall ripples in roughly the spot
that you're standing in front of. You lean closer and something seems to reach
for you! A moment later there's a huge ripple all along the wall, then all is
still. You think. Was that a ripple over there?
~
E
ceiling~
Which ones the ceiling now? Wait, don't even bother trying. Your head will
explode and I don't want the mess all over the glowing wall. It hates it when
that happens.
~
E
floor light~
It's pale stone/red rugs one moment then {YBRIGHT LIGHT{x the next. It appears
to be solid, however, as you are quite clearly standing on it. You appear to
be standing on it, anyway. You can't be sure about anything in here. The floor
returns a few moments later. You think.
~
E
engraving~
Upon closer examination there are actually numerous engravings. They are just
set close together. Some of them read; "East then sign, west and death, east
then eye.", "Wibble!", "The bunnies agreed to it. Should be great.",
"<Unreadable>", "The Scifi channel is run by idiots. Here's to their
bankruptcy.", "If you can't beat em, shoot 'em instead.", "Microsoft Messenger
is a damn virus. A virus, I say!", "Draagdim was a total mess." "Have you
hugged your friendly Immie today?", "Nina is the traitor? That's bullcrap
both logically and otherwise.", "Hells Bells and surgical procedures.", and
"http://xeddicus.homestead.com/files/DD4.avi". "Addendum: Sigh, damnit."
~
E
dart board~
It looks just like a normal dart board (except for the legs and the moving)
until it notices you looking at it and sprouts some hands, pulls the darts
from out of its body, and lobs them at you. And it figures, the darts seem to
magically replenish themselves on the things body. Incoming!
~
E
carcass asverna corpse~
It's been perfectly preserved it appears. Next to the body is a picture. After
a moment you realize that you're looking at what the body looked like before
it was put back together and apparently healed up with some magic. There isn't
much in the picture but some fangs, a set of claws, and a big red spot.
~
E
wool balls ball~
They appear to be totally crazed maniacal wool balls. They holler blinding
insults at each other as they collide in an awesome fury of violence. Being
wool balls, however, they harmlessly bounce off each other. This doesn't seem
to stop them, though, as they get back up and vow to do something with their
enemies' cat, a plastic pencil, a bowl full of gerbils and their enemies'
great great grandmother. You thankfully don't quite make out whatever it is,
however.
~
E
bookshelf~
It appears to be made of plywood. You expect it to try and kill you at any
moment. It deftly just sits there holding books, instead, slowly lulling you
into a false sense of security.
~
E
book books~
They look like typical books on the outside, but when you open them up some of
them appear to be writing themselves as you read. Others contain some of those
damn holes that are all over the room. Yet others appear to be ALIVE and not
books at all. One of them tells you to kiss its ass or put it down. Nice.

~
E
room~
Trying to look at the whole room at once eh? Sadly, that's a mistake.
Your mind just can't handle the load and-

{RYou have been KILLED!!{x

Your vision clouds, your senses become dulled.  Strange vapours
gather about your twitching and bleeding body, and there is the
sensation of flight.  Dazzling lights flicker within your mind
and strange whispers are heard from all directions.

After an age, your head clears.  You sit bewildered in the hazy
gloom of the Underworld...and then you fall into one of those
bloody holes back into the room.

The Hallway~
This hallway is richly panelled and carpeted.  Doors lead off on either side
along the hall, with names on gold plaques above the doors.  The hallway seems
to go on forever; it is clearly magical, as the Millionaire's Club does not
seem to be this big from the outside.  The plaque above the door to the north
reads "Adrioth"; the plaque above the southern door reads "Dexx".

Adrioth's Elysian Fields~
You step through the door and suddenly sunlight hits you, you wonder if you
died and are in heaven or some such thing. The door behind you leads back to
the club hallway, but the door itself is floating in mid-air; all around you is
a field of flowers and grass, and you slowly begin to remember stories of this
place. It is very peaceful here and all you see is flowers, gentle streams,
and soft hued mountains in the distance; butterflies float around you, and in
the distance you see large golden gates.  Welcome, To the Elysian fields.

Dexx's {dArmory{x~
Weapons of all kinds line the walls. Shields and armor are hanging
from rafters and on stands. Among the devices of war are tables and
chairs, apparently for such bizarre activities as eating. There
appear to be more rooms, possibly bedrooms and the like, in the back.
The door leading there, however, informs you to stay the hell out when
you try to open it. You notice a strange pattern drawn on the ground
to one side and a sign hanging above it that reads "If you hear a
chime: MOVE! Or else.". There are a few daggers and a battleaxe
embedded in the back wall next to the door that refuses to let you
past. This is somewhat impressive since the walls are solid stone.
Oh, and there's an animal of some kind looking at you too. Try
not to make any sudden moves, it looks vicious.

They all appear to be normal daggers, except for the fact they're sunk
up to their hilts in a stone wall. So it's possible the blades are
glowing or on fire or something, but you'll never know.

It's battleaxe-like. Trust me.

It's solid stone. So solid it must be reinforced with magic. The slight

This hallway is richly panelled and carpeted.  The hallway seems to go on
forever; it is clearly magical, as the Millionaire's Club does not seem to be
this big from the outside.  This section of the hallway seems warmer to you,
and yet you shiver all the same.  You feel an evil presence somewhere nearby.
Instead of a door to the north there is a fiery portal. You can faintly hear
tormented screams coming through the portal, and you shudder in terror.  Above
the portal there is a plaque that reads "Shroud".  There is a door to the
south; a plaque above the door reads "Firetongue".

Shroud's Lair~
You stumble upon a cavernous chamber.  The fires of Hell burn hotter here
and the stench of sulphur permeates the air.  The skulls of challengers
ruthlessly destroyed line the walls, while their tormented souls hover in
eternal servitude.

Shroud is here relaxing in a bubbling pool of sulphur.  Your blood runs
cold as he turns his fiery eyes upon you and intones in a thunderous
voice, 'What foolish mortal dares to enter my lair?'

Firetongue's Room~
Trepidation courses through your body as you enter the room of Firetongue,
Alaghi, Aesir, Warlock. Crude wooden logs atop heavy granite blocks make up
the walls of this square, dark room. The room is dominated by a huge
fireplace, located in the very center. Sitting in front of the fire with his
back turned against you is a medium sized Alaghi. He stares intently into the
fire, and you think you can hear some vague murmuring coming from him. You
carefully pick a path between the spoils of war that litter the room, anxious
not to disturb anything as you make your way towards the middle of the room.
Curiously enough gold, gems and other commonly valuable items seems to be held
in little regard here, lying strewn all over the hard-packed dirt floor, while
items like swords and common armor are stacked more or less neatly along the
walls.  On closer inspection you realize that many of the weapons are broken,
and the armors are scarred by weapon marks, fire scorching and acid burns.
You are now close enough to overhear some of the sounds coming from the
Alaghi. "Mordekai is dead...Klinga gone..." "My lord...war...rages".

Intrigued, curiosity overcoming your sense of caution, you edge a bit closer,
managing to catch the last phrases of the spiritual conversation. "Yes my
Lord, if it is your will, I will take on the mantle as leader of the Aesir in
this world!" The alaghi rises as he speaks the last words, and is greeted by a
sudden roaring from the fire. He turns and speaks to you, as if he knew that
you where here all the time.

"Even though you have snuck into my home I shall let you live. You shall be my
harbinger, to spread the word that the war continues, and that the Aesir has a
new leader, Firetongue!"

Truk's Bachelor Pad~
As you step through the door you notice that it is about ten times your size.
In fact looking around you can see that everything is ten times your size. In
the far corner you see an enormous four posted bed. Taking a closer look you
can see that the bed is not empty. As a matter of fact it is quite full. You
can't quite make out faces but you can see several shapes moving around. You
can also hear the deep booming laughter of the man who must own this place and
several different tones of female giggles. Thinking it better not to disturb
them you look at the rest of the room. You can see that each wall has at least
one picture of a fierce battle. Some cover the entire wall and some are not as
large. There are scattered clothes in amongst random pieces of armor. A large
fancy glass table lines the wall opposite the bed. Atop the table are various
maps and construction plans. A shelf next to the table contains glass jars
filled with a black powder, a few water skins, and what looks to be a pair
of dragon's eggs. After having your fill of the room you think it best to
leave before you are noticed.

bed~
You see an enormous four posted bed made out of what looks like large
smooth bones. Centred on the footboard is an engraved dragon's head. It looks
vaguely familiar but when you think about it all you can remember is the
dragon's head lying in a circle of trees.
~
E
west wall~
Painted on the western wall you see a giant cloaked figure holding
a sword dripping with poison. All around him are the scorched corpses of what
used to be vampires. The only thing left standing in the room is a very large,
very muscular vampire surrounded by a white aura and flames. The vampire is
wielding a cruelly spiked gothik mace and a shield with a large bat on it.
~
E
north wall~
Painted on the north wall is a glorious battle between two large
powerful men. One is heavily armored and holding and giant sword, coated with
poison, that seems to vibrate, while the other appears to be a hunter of some
sort.
~
E
east wall~
Along the east wall above the table shows a picture of conquest. It
shows a large man waving a poison coated sword in the air over the corpse of a
large dragon. The wings have been severed as well as the claws. There is also
a large orb glowing red and white.
~
E
south wall~
Other than the large door, the south wall has some small
paintings. One is with a giant cloaked figure with a large sword coated in
poison fighting an enormous dragon in the void. Another shows the same cloaked
figure fighting a man in the midst of a room of portals. Yet another shows
the cloaked figure fighting a large dragon atop a tower.
~
E
clothes~
Looking at the clothes scattered around the room you notice that they
don't all belong to the same person. There are various under garments,
dresses, skirts, as well as some pants and shirts.
~
E
armor~
Looking among the armor scattered across the floor you can tell that
most of it is shaped for females except for the large set of armor next to the
bed.
~
E
table~
As you peer into the glass table you notice a swirling of colours and
see a reflection of the past. You can see many mighty hero's roaming the land
helping new adventurers. You also notice big wars between many of the various
clans. And that's when at the height of this Domain that the GODS sent their
fury. Fire rained, the seas boiled, and storms appeared everywhere casting
their bolts of lightning. Elementals sprang up  from every crack and destroyed
the Domain to make it anew.
~
E
maps~
The maps here are of various cities. Anon, Midgaard, Kerofk, Solace, and
Ofcol. Looking over the plans laid out next to them, it seems like the
beginnings of a new city. One of a scale no one has seen before.
~
E
shelf shelves~
The shelf contains glass jars filled with a black powder, a few water
skins, and what looks to be a pair of dragon's eggs.

faults are blasted out and wonders beyond dreams are put in. One of the final
murals represents Samxin inserting a living sword into the mighty city, and
then sealing it away. An in flux portal showing many places in the world hangs
in the center of the room.

road leads out to the East Gate.  The smell coming from the south can
only be made by fish.  The Port Quarter lies south of you.

far east tied up.

Temple of Jammer~
You are standing a small shrine dedicated to the god Jammer.  Soft
music, seemingly coming from inside your head, calms you as you
survey this rather plain looking room.  There are statues of various
musical instruments, some easily recognized and others curiously
familiar.  A large word hangs over the doorway leading to the street.
It reads: "Marshall(tm)".  Its meaning escapes you.

(Torment), a {rWibb{gl{ye{x (Samxin) and a curious object which appears

seem to be this big from the outside.  The plaques in this section of the
