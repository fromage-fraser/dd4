witch hag woman~
a witch~
A robust woman grins as she watches you in her cottage.
~
She appears to be an old woman whom you guess to be a witch since
she has in her hand a wand, which she is waving over a glowing
red book.

Witches, of course, are learned in the psionic arts. Perhaps she
can educate you in psionicism and witchery?

A Tropical Sea~
    You have reached the calm warm waters of the Yeats Sea.
The clear blue-green waters support a variety of life below the surface.
Stuck to simply wondering above though, you notice land to the south and
east, but volcanic lava flows prevent landing.

    You traverse the calm warm waters of the Yeats Sea.
The clear blue-green waters support a variety of life below the surface.
The sea continues south and east. You see land to the north and west
seemingly unconnected with that on which Midgaard rests. The banks
are too steep to climb.

The Dock~
    The dock is made of old greyed timber. Not very much could
stop at so small a dock with such shallow water around it. There are no
apparent reasons for a dock even being here, since there is no visible
trail in any direction. The only exit takes you back to the Sea.

simply wondering above though, you notice land to the south and
west on which forested hills rise and fall like the waves of the sea for as
far as the eye can see. The shores are too steep to climb.

A Small Path~
    As you slowly force your way through the head high weeds
the path becomes clearer. Going just far enough to be out of sight
of where you stepped on to the island, you can see a small cottage
ahead steeped in shadow with light filtering though the shutters of a
small window.

Beside the Cottage~
    You stand in front of a small cottage made of shabbily
connected boards and sticks, the kinds of things one might see
floating down a river. As you approached a noise came from
within, and now all is quiet.  The entrance is to the west, or you
may return on the path to the south.

Inside the Cottage~
    Around the room you can see a number of books and
flasks, perhaps used in the manufacture of magical potions. On
the far side of the room from where you stand the picture of a
beautiful woman dressed in a formal gown can be seen. A door
leading outside is east of here.

A Beach~
    You come to a narrow beach.  Vertical cliffs loom to the east and west,
and the harsh ocean is to the south.  To the north, you can see a less steep
mountain ahead, which you can probably climb.

Along the Beach~
    You are along the beach.  Evidently, not many people travel on this
rocky shore, and you are lucky you found this place.  Continuing north is the
foot of a large mountain, while south of you, you can hear the roar of the
waves crashing against the rocky beach.  The vertical cliffs to the east and
west block any movement in those directions.

Foot of the Mountain~
    You are at the foot of the mountain.  A narrow trail leads up the face
of the mountain to the north, while the beach leads back south toward the
ocean.  Vertical cliffs block all travel east and west.  It almost looks as if
stairs have been carved into the trail to the north.
