      Only Immortals may use the IMMTALK and DIRTALK channels.
~


0 CLANS~
Clans are groups of adventurers who believe in the same ideals, beliefs
and values.  These adventurers band together to offer each other mutual
support, help and friendship.

Clans can be formed by anyone above level 50 who has at least one other
player who wishes to join their clan.  The Imms reserve the right to final
judgement on who can form a clan.

To join a clan, see the leader of that clan and read the help file for
that clan.  Note that if you wish to join a clan, you must do so before
level {Y40{x, and after level {Y20{x.

Belonging to a Clan can have the following advantages:

    Communication with members of your clan through a clan channel that
    only your clan members can hear.

    Communication to other clan members through the form of a clan note
    system.

    A hide-away or headquarters where you can meet with comrades to
    discuss personal matters and rest.

    Healing in the form of a clan healer, located in your clan HQ.

    Healing items that double the rate of healing when you are next to
    them.  You can steal other clans items to increase your rate by even
    more.

    Clan equipment.  There are four clan items, one gained as soon as you
    clan; another gained at level 30 that is worn in same place; another
    gained at level 60; and a clan belt-pouch gained at level 50.  These
    items carry powerful healing and combat bonuses.

Most importantly, clans also allow you to PKILL.  See the relevant section
of the FAQ for more details (see 'HELP FAQ').

Note that you don't get a KILLER flag if you kill members of other CLANS
You WILL get a KILLER flag if you kill non-clan members.

There are currently five active clans: {GTRV{x, {MSOM{x, {YAES{x, {dCOB{x and {RLOE{x.

See 'HELP <clan>' for individual clan information.  Also see 'HELP CLAN
COMMANDS'.
~


0 RONIN~
Ronin are masterless pkillers that have no allegiance to any clan.  They
do not have access to clan headquarters or clan equipment, but otherwise
may murder other ronin or clanned players without penalty.

Ronin status is granted by Immortals only.  You are allowed to become
ronin with the understanding that you will most likely have to remove
ALL of your characters from any clans they are members of.

Immortals should read 'HELP RONIN COMMANDS' for related information.
~


0 'SECOND SPELL' 'THIRD SPELL' 'FOURTH SPELL' ATTACK~

These techniques enable a caster to cast two, three, or even four
combat spells per round.  Note that THIRD SPELL has only a 70% chance of
success and FOURTH SPELL a 45% chance, due to the enormous drain on the
caster.

NOTE: you need to change the frequency of your spell-casting per round
using the ATTACK command.  Enter 'ATTACK <1-4>'.  Non-combat spells are
not cast multiple times.
~


0 'CLAN COMMANDS' CLANTALK CSCORE GUILD PROMOTE LEAVE~
CLANTALK <text>
        Lets you talk to your clan members only.  `>' is the shortcut key.

CSCORE
        Displays your clan score.

GUILD <character> [remove]
        Clan leaders may add people to their clan by typing `GUILD
        <character>'.  They may remove clan members by typing `GUILD
        <character> REMOVE'; leaders may not remove other leaders. The
        character must be between below level 40 and above level 20.

PROMOTE <character> <level>
        Leaders may promote clan members from levels 0 through 3.
        Use the PROMOTE command to demote clan level also.

LEAVE
        Leave your clan.  You will not become Ronin, although you will
        be flagged as a deserter and will not be able to rejoin a clan
        without an Immortal's help.

Leaders should read 'HELP CLAN ITEMS' for information on clan equipment.
~


102 LEADER~
Syntax: leader <target>

This command will make the target a clan leader, able to add people into
their clan with the GUILD command and load clan equipment using OCLANITEM.
You must guild intended leaders first before giving them their leader flag.
~

102 GUIDE~
Syntax: guide <target>

This command will make the target a guide, able to use the newbie channel
after level 5.  Clanned players cannot be guides but otherwise there are
no restrictions.
~

102 'RONIN COMMANDS'~
Syntax: ronin <target>

Toggle whether a player is flagged RONIN.

0 CHANGE~
Syntax: change <subclass abbreviation>

When you reach level 30, you have the opportunity to select a subclass:
to specialise in one of the two subclasses for your base class.  Head to the
city of Kerofk to find a trainer that will help you change.  If you want
to remain as your base class, just continue to level as usual.

The opportunity to change is only available during your 30th level: as
soon as you reach 31 you will not be able to select a subclass.

The following abbreviations are used to subclass:

{YSub-class       Abbreviation    Sub-class       Abbreviation{x
Necromancer     Nec             Warlock         Wlk

0 CHANGES~

{WMarch 2022{x}

We're back!

Apart from getting everything running again, the following new skills have 
been added;

- Chaos Blast for Satanists
- Detect Curse for those with Divination
- Knife Toss for Thieves
- New config option: "AUTOLEVEL"
- Gravity exists!
- Grouping Bonuses for support skills & spells

Refer appropriate HELP entries.

We're also trying to tidy up a lot of minor issues, formatting, spelling, 
links in areas, and things like that.  

There are skills that open up which you then can't practice at that 
teacher which we're trying to track down as well.

Please let us know if you see anything along those lines and we'll attempt
to get them tidied up.

0 MULTIPLAYING MULTIPLAYERS~

Multiplay is defined as one player controlling/playing more than one
character at a time.  There are multiplay rules for pkilling, see help
PKILL RULES.

You are not allowed to have more than two characters on at once. These
two characters cannot be in the field together, for whatever reason.
There are no exceptions.  Standing at a questmaster or in a major town
does not count as being in the field.

The Imms reserve the right to decide what is and isn't multiplay.  If you
think it might be dodgy, don't do it or you'll probably regret it.

The DD Team
~


0 DECAPITATE DECAPITATION~
Syntax: decapitate

Attempt to cut off your opponents head during battle.  Your victim must be
sufficiently hurt for the decapitation attempt to succeed.  You also need
to be using a 'vorpal' weapon.

~

0 FAME~
Fame is a way of measuring how courageous a player is as she rises through
the levels of the Domain.

There are a number of ways to gain fame and it is generally only rewarded
for acts of heroism or bravery.

Fame can be gained by:
    * Killing mobs 6 or levels higher than your own.
    * By killing particularly famous or infamous creatures.
    * By completing quests.
    * As special reward from the Immortals.

Fame can be lost by
    * Killing helpful creatures or people such as healers, shopkeepers
          and Questors.
    * Obtaining a KILLER or THIEF flag.
    * Dying.
    * Fleeing or recalling from combat.

Being famous has its advantages; shopkeepers will give you discounts if
you are famous enough.

Being infamous, i.e. having negative fame, is a bad thing.  You will not
be able to level and shopkeepers will not serve you.
~

0 RULES~
Bugs
        * If you find a bug report it IMMEDIATELY to an Imm.
        * Do not take it upon yourself to exploit or test a bug you find.

Player Killing
        * There is an Arena if non-clanned players wish to battle other players
              without getting a KILLER flag; see 'HELP ARENA'.
        * If you do get a KILLER flag, you must ask an Immortal to pardon
              you.  You will generally be let off the hook if you gained the
              flag by accident.
        * If you want to kill players legally, you must join a clan.
        * See the relevant section of the FAQ for more details: 'HELP FAQ'.

Player Stealing

              your own.

Auto-players; bots
        * Any characters controlled by programs or scripts will be deleted.
          AI ain't that good yet that we can't spot you, baby.

~

-1 NECROMANCER~
Necromancer subclass (base class Mage)

The necromancer perverts nature with bizarre death and disease magiks,
commanding the forces of growth and decay for their own twisted ends.
With the spells WITHER, HEX and FEAR they can be gruesome opponents.
Able to ANIMATE DEAD, they can rise to command legions of undead slaves.
Fear these horrible wizards!
~

-1 WARLOCK~
Warlock subclass (base class Mage)

Battle grounds are not places for sorcerers, who need constant protection
from opposing forces.  Not so with the warlock.  Combining awesome magic
with skill at arms, the warlock is free to do battle hand to hand, or at a
distance.  A formidable enemy.
~

-1 TEMPLAR~
Templar subclass (base class Cleric)

Melee can sometimes be too much for the cloistered cleric.  It's time to
bring out some religious muscle.  The templar, combining religious piety
with skilful sword-play, is a force to be reckoned with.
~

-1 DRUID~
Druid subclass (base class Cleric)

A druid serves the cause of nature and neutrality; the wilderness is his
home, and his strength.  The devastating powers of nature can be unleashed
in the druids WITHER, SUNRAY and MOONRAY spells.  The druid may also BREW
potions and SCRIBE scrolls to contain magical energies.

-1 THUG~
Thug subclass (base class Warrior)

The thug is essentially the opposite of the gallant knight.  Brawling,
blackmail and bashing enemies over the head are the thug's favourite
pastimes.  Their ability to INTIMIDATE their opponents makes them greatly
feared, and by EXTORTING shopkeepers they can earn a bit of extra cash to
fund their illegal operations.  SMASHing people with a shield soon brings
them around to a thug's point of view.
~

-1 KNIGHT~
Knight subclass (base class Warrior)

Standing for gallantry and all that is good and noble, a knight will deal
to any evil that steps in its way.  A mounted knight may JOUST and then
DESTRIER his crippled opponent; he may also cast a range of curative
healing spells, or unleash a FLAMESTRIKE upon the enemy.
~

-1 MONK~
Monk subclass (base class Brawler)

Strict mental and physical disciplines make monks talented fighters and
spell casters.  A range of psionic abilities and defensive manoeuvres
including BLINK and ACROBATICS make monks hard targets to hit in combat.
~

-1 WITCH~
Witch subclass (base class Psionic)

Black magic and curses are the focus of the witch's study.  HEX, STEAL
SOUL, ENTRAPMENT and FEAR can reduce enemies to quivering wrecks.  Witches
can then ANIMATE DEAD to torment the living.

Project a force ball at your opponent to inflict horrible damage.

same scroll.

scriber.

brewer.

found east from the Healer in Midgaard, where others can feast on your

increased rate.  This skill is automatic once practised.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~

0 HUNT~
Syntax: hunt <target>

Hunt down a creature from almost anywhere in the world.  Good for finding
difficult targets, or working through mazes and random areas.
~

0 STUN~
Syntax: stun <target>

Smash a person on the head and render them unconscious.  A stunned
opponent is an easy target to hit, and is vulnerable to damage.  You
must use a pounding weapon if you want to be able to stun.
~


0 SCAN~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: scan <direction>

Look briefly about you to account for the exits and creatures nearby.
~

0 GRIP~
Improves your chances at preventing someone from disarming your weapon.
This skill is used automatically once learned.
~

0 WARCRY~
Syntax: warcry

Improves a warrior's performance in combat by inducing a battle frenzy.
A fighter will hit more often and do increased damage after making a warcry.
~

0 BERSERK~
Syntax: berserk

Become enraged during combat: you will inflict more damage, but leave
yourself open to more attacks due to your recklessness.  Once you have
gone berserk, you will not be able to FLEE or RESCUE.
~

0 SMASH~
Syntax: smash <target>

Smash an opponent to the ground, and gain a free attack as they try to
recover.  You must be wearing a shield to smash your opponent with.
~

0 ASSASSINATE ASSASSINATION~
Gain a chance of instantly killing an opponent after an attempted
BACKSTAB.  This skill is used automatically once learned.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: buy   <number> <object>
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.

'BUY <number> <object>' will let you buy multiple items at once.
E.g. 'BUY 20 PIE' will let you collect 20 pies at once.

LIST with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.

'LIST <object>' lists only the items corresponding with <object> the shop
keeper will sell you.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he will buy the item for.

BUY, SELL, and VALUE, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of the '#.object' format, where # is a number or the word
"all".  For example, if 'LIST DAGGER' showed you that a shopkeeper had
five daggers, and you were interested in buying the third one, you would
type: 'BUY 3.DAGGER'. ~

0 PETS~
You can buy pets from a pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use
them or lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> [target]

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you
practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting
spells costs mana.  The mana cost decreases for many spells as your level
increases.

The [target] is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name.  E.g. CAST 'CURE CRITICAL' FRAG.  Quoting is optional for
single-word spells.  You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are
visible.  You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to
walk in a certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have
AUTOEXIT set, you will automatically see the visible exits whenever you
walk into a room.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> <coin type>
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> <coin type> <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or
even from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of the '#.object' format, where # is a number or the word
"all".  For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the
third one away, you would type 'GIVE 3.DAGGER FRAG'.  Or if you felt
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type 'DROP ALL.PIE'.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY ALLOWEQ~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: equipment <any argument>
Syntax: inventory
Syntex: alloweq

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).

EQUIPMENT supplied with any text as an argument will also show empty
equipment slots.

INVENTORY lists your visible inventory.

ALLOWEQ toggles whether other players can view your equipment or not when
they look at you.  See also HELP DESCRIPTION.

Other players can never view your inventory.

~

0 KICK~
Syntax: kick <target>

Kick an opponent during battle, causing some damage.
~

0 'KNIFE TOSS'~
Syntax: KNIFE <target>

Thieves are good with small throwing knives and can toss them at enemies during combat doing some damage.
~


0 BACKSTAB BS 'DOUBLE BACKSTAB'~
Syntax: backstab <target>
Syntax: bs <target>

Sneak behind your opponent and plunge a blade into their back, causing
grievous damage.  If you've practised DOUBLE BACKSTAB, you can repeat the
attack.  You need to wield a piercing or stabbing weapon in order to
backstab.
~

0 CIRCLE 'SECOND CIRCLE'~
Syntax: circle

Skirt behind your opponent to make a surprise attack.  A CIRCLE will not
cause as much damage as a BACKSTAB.  If you have practised SECOND CIRCLE,
you may attempt to strike twice.
~

0 DISARM~
Syntax: disarm [target]

Attempt to disarm your opponent's weapon.  You must be wielding a weapon
in order to disarm.
~

0 KILL MURDER~
Syntax: kill   <target>
Syntax: murder <target>

Attack a creature, with mind to end their life.  If you want to attack
another player, you must use MURDER.
~


0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: read    <keyword>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK <container>' followed by 'LOOK IN <container>'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ <sign>' than to
'LOOK <sign>', doesn't it?
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all         command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and
they will no longer follow your orders.
~


0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: wake <character>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana and movement points faster.  However, you are
more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP, you won't hear many things
happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can also WAKE
other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a
message to all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if
they are sleeping, stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can
GTELL no matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting,
mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote
(') is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will
work even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their
identity.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start
using it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.
WEAR is for armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

'WEAR ALL' will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does
not match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced
enough to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

100 WIZHELP~

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

       {wmiss          decimate         {RDEMOLISH          VAPOURIZE{x
       {wscratch       mangle           {RDEVASTATE         ATOMIZE{x

       {wmaul          {WMASSACRE         {RBRUTALISE{x
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated in purgatory.  Your corpse
is taken by the Death Reaper and protected from scavengers.  You must find
your way through Purgatory to your corpse in order to reclaim your
possessions.  Miraculously, however, your money stays with you, so
apparently you CAN take it with you.

Any spells which were affecting you, good and bad, are cancelled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half-way
back to the beginning of your level.  Thus if you have a bad day and die
several times, the penalties won't clobber you.  You won't lose any
experience if you die in the Arena (see 'HELP ARENA').

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real
time).  Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can
retrieve objects from a player's corpse.
~


0 ARENA~
Syntax: arena

By typing this command, you are transported into the Arena of Death. The
Arena is a place where players can come an attempt to kill each other
without the fear of getting a KILLER flag or any other penalties for dying
that they might normally get (loss of experience, fame, etc).

The ARENA can also be accessed by heading west from the Midgaard healer.
Note that the only way out is by death or by recalling.

The spell DISINTEGRATE will not function in the Arena.  Breath weapons
will not destroy equipment either, although they inflict the usual amount
of damage.

Listen to a commentary of Arena fights on the arena channel ('CHANNEL
+ARENA' to turn on).

Also see 'HELP TOURNAMENT'.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience and quest points.
The amount of experience and quest points needed to get to the next level
increases the higher level you are.  However, the experience gained from
high level creatures is a lot higher than low level creatures.

You gain experience by:
        * Killing any creature.
        * Damaging any creature of reasonable relative strength.
        * Being part of a group of characters that adventures.

You lose experience by:
        * Fleeing or recalling from combat.
        * Dying.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:
        * How many players are in your group.
        * Your level versus the level of the creatures you kill.
        * Your alignment compared to your victims' alignments.
        * How many times a victim has been killed recently.

There is a maximum amount of experience points that you can lose each
level; after a certain number of deaths, you will not be penalised for
subsequent deaths until you level again.

See 'HELP QUEST' for information on quest points needed to gain levels.
~


0 TICK~
Many events and actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hit point/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hit point/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly
called the 'tick'.  Ticks on this MUD average 30 seconds of real time; the
actual amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if someone is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it
resets.

You can tell when an area is about to reset by the patter of little feet.
~


0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object 1> <object 2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are
weapons, it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both
objects are armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the
object you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than
COMPARE.
~

104 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the only
way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE may also
be used to demote characters.
~

0 CONSIDER 'ADVANCED CONSIDER'~
Syntax: consider <target>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, as well
as a comparison of your relative health.  Of course, it's only a rough
estimate.

Those with the ADVANCED CONSIDER skill are able to gain more detailed
information about an opponent.

~

0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <text>
Syntax: title

Sets your title to a given string.  Typing TITLE alone will force your
title blank.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that
reduces your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically
attempt to flee.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit
points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 QUESTS~

Questing is an important part of a character's life in DD.  You will need
to gain 'quest points' in order to level and have access to special recall
points scattered about the mud.  You will also need to quest to gain
powerful combat artefacts and equipment.

There are three types of quests offered in the Domain: randomised quests
organised by special questmaster mobs; specific, unvarying quests set in
the Adventurers Guild and other places in Midgaard; and unique quests set
by Immortals.  Set quests and Imm quests are not discussed here: see the
DD FAQ for more details ('HELP FAQ').  Random quests are also discussed
in the FAQ.

Randomised quests offer 'quest points' and money as rewards.  You use the
'QUEST' command to request and complete these quests, once you have found
a quest master.  Suturb, in the Adventurer's Guild in Midgaard, will offer
quests to low-level characters.

You may use the following commands:

QUEST POINTS
        How many quest points you have.  Quest points are used to buy
        recall points.

QUEST INFO
        Will remind you of your current quest.

QUEST TIME
        Will tell you how much time you have left on your current quest or
        how long remaining till you can quest again.  You can also put this
        information in your prompt (see 'HELP PROMPT').

QUEST REQUEST
        Will request a quest from someone suitable.  You will find that
        sometimes the questmaster has no available quests for you.  If
        this is the case it would be advisable to return at a later date.

QUEST COMPLETE
        Tell the quest giver you have finished your quest, and they will
        then bestow your reward.

QUEST ABORT
        Abandon your current quest.  You must wait a while before you may
        request another.

QUEST LIST
        List what recall points you may buy with your quest points.

QUEST BUY <recall point name>
        Buy a recall point.

Quest points spent will still be recorded in your total quest points
earned so they still count towards those needed for advancing levels.

See 'HELP RECALL' for information about using recall points.

See 'HELP QP LEVEL' for a list of how many quest points are needed to
reach certain levels.

See 'HELP QUESTMASTERS' for the identities of questmasters.

Also, read the relevant section of the FAQ ('HELP FAQ').
~

0 QUESTMASTERS~

There are four questmasters scattered throughout the Domain.  For those
characters level 25 and under, Suturb in the Adventurer's Guild in Midgaard
will provide quests.  After level 25, you will need to range further afield.
Goldmoon, near Solace, the Mercenary Master in Anon, and Dahij, near Kerofk,
all provide quests.  Note that the questmasters who are more difficult to
journey to provide greater rewards for your efforts.
~

0 CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other
players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.

CHAT and MUSIC also send messages to all interested players.  '.' is a
synonym for CHAT.

You must achieve level 5 to CHAT, SHOUT or MUSIC, before then use NEWBIE.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these
channels.
~

0 EMOTE , POSE~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

POSE is a variant of EMOTE.
~

0 BOARDS 'NOTE SYSTEM'~

board [number or name]                Shows or changes board.
note                                  Reads next note.
note read [number]                    Reads a certain note.
note remove <number>                  Removes a note written by you.
note list [number]                    Shows up to number notes.
note write                            Posts a note.
note catchup                          Marks all notes in this board read.

These commands are used for the new note system.  Instead of just one
board, there are several, each with its special purpose.

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number
of unread message. To change, type 'BOARD <number>' or 'BOARD <name of the
board>'.

To read next unread note, type NOTE.  To read a note with a specified
number, type 'NOTE READ <number>'.  Typing NOTE while in a board with no
unread notes shifts you to the next board.  Note that unlike the standard
note system, a note has the same number in 'NOTE LIST' and 'NOTE READ'.

Posting a message is as simple as writing 'NOTE WRITE'.  You will be moved
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like
'To:', 'From:', etc.  You will be automatically put AFK while writing a
note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type 'NOTE LIST'.
Typing 'NOTE LIST <number>' will list only <number> of the latest notes.

You can remove your own note by using 'NOTE REMOVE <number>'.  Immortals
may remove other people's notes.  Immortals can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged.  Purging happens automatically at
bootup.  Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only Immortals see your note, address it to "imm".  To let players
of a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other
recipients may appear in that case).

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk,
aka Phunk and is freely available.  The general outlook was based on
Mystic Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap
Syntax: zap      <target>

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  You must be HOLDing the staff.

QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane
liquids).

RECITE recites a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on
the nature of the scroll.  You must be HOLDing the scroll.

ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and
you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target.  You
must be HOLDing the wand.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a
single charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical
object has no more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK 'PICK LOCK'~
Syntax: open   <object or direction>
Syntax: close  <object or direction>
Syntax: lock   <object or direction>
Syntax: unlock <object or direction>
Syntax: pick   <object or direction>

OPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  PICKing successfully, is
easier if you practice the appropriate skill, but anyone can buy a
lockpick and have a go (with a much higher chance of failure).  The
lockpick must be in your inventory when you make the attempt to have a
chance of success.

Also see 'HELP BASH'.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something. There is a drinking fountain in
the Temple Square in Midgaard, as well as others throughout the Domain.

When you are hungry, EAT something. The baker in Midgaard sells pies,
and other vendors are located throughout the Domain.

FILL fills a drink container with water.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your god.  Your god may reward you for the
sacrifice. The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.

Hint: Gods like corpses.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight is
not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can RESCUE
you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work, and costs
more experience points.)

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances of
making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

RESCUE lets you save a group member from being the focus of their
attacker.  Whoever is fighting the rescued group member will change the focus 
of their attacks to the rescuer.  If your group member is facing multiple 
opponents you'll need to rescue them multiple times.  Note you can set the
order of your group so that when you walk into a room one member gets 
attacked initially - see HELP GRORDER for details.
~

0 'BASH DOOR'~
Syntax: bash <direction>

A powerful warrior can attempt to by-pass the intricacies of unlocking and
opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course, tends to
make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.  Be aware,
however, that bashing is a fairly aggressive action, and some mobs don't
take kindly to that type of behaviour...
~

0 'CHAMELEON POWER'~
Syntax: chameleon

With CHAMELEON POWER, a psionicist uses the power of his or her mind to
change the appearance and colouration of his or her body, armor, and
equipment to blend in with the surroundings.  This skill is only effective
if the psionicist remains absolutely still.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP GRLEADER GRORDER~
Syntax: follow   <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group    <character>
Syntax: grorder  <character>
Syntax: grleader

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone
else, just 'FOLLOW <yourself>'.

'GROUP <character>' makes someone who is following you a member of your
group.  Group members share experience points from kills and will gain
bonus experience for supporting each other from some skills and spells.  
If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically join the fight.

Group members may use the GTELL and SPLIT commands.

If <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will kick
them out of your group.  Characters can also leave your group by using a
FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

GRORDER sets the leader of your group. The leader is the player that gets
attacked by aggressive mobs when the group walks in on one.  This assumes
that the mob can see the leader and that the leader is in the same room.

GRLEADER reports on who the current leader of the group is.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within ten levels of
your own.
~

0 'HEIGHTEN SENSES'~
Syntax: heighten

Improve your senses to detect things that would otherwise pass unnoticed.
~


0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: hide
Syntax: sneak
Syntax: visible

If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.

If you successfully SNEAK, you attempt to merge into the shadows, and
hence will be able to move in and out of rooms undetected.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~


0 POISON~
Syntax: cast poison <victim>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim, as well as reducing their
regeneration rate.
~

0 'POISON WEAPON'~
Syntax: poison <weapon>

Create a deadly poison that can be poured onto any weapon, rendering it
more deadly.  This skill is not easy, however, because the poison itself
requires special ingredients, and you must be steady of hand and
clear of mind.

Be Warned!  The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon in
due time.  The '(Damaged)' flag appears on poisoned weapons that are
close to becoming unusable.
~


0 QUIT SAVE~
Syntax: quit
Syntax: save

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level
to save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether
you save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, may not
be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  When you re-enter the game you will be back in the
same room.  QUIT automatically performs a SAVE.
~

0 RECALL / HOME~
Syntax: recall
Syntax: recall list
Syntax: recall set <number of recall point>
Syntax: home

Pray for miraculous transportation to your current recall point.  '/' is a
shortcut key for RECALL.

If you are in a clan, you can recall to your clan headquarters by typing
HOME.

Type 'RECALL LIST' for a list of what recalls you may use, and which
recall is set as your current destination.  You gain extra recall points
as quest rewards (see 'HELP QUEST').

Type 'RECALL SET <number>' to change your recall destination.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for
fleeing).  RECALL costs half of your movement points.  RECALL doesn't work
in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a curse will not
recall at all.
~

0 'SHADOW FORM'~
Syntax: shadow

A psionicist can use his or her mind power to blend in with the shadows
while moving, having the same effect as the skill SNEAK.  Type VISIBLE to
come out of shadow form.
~

0 SPELLS~
Syntax: spells

This command shows the spell caster how much mana each spell he or she
knows will cost.

For a list of all available spells for your class, type SLIST.
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: split <equivalent amount of copper coins>

Share an amount of coins between all members of your group.
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: steal coins    <character>
Syntax: steal <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players, see HELP RULES.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the
same area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of all creatures with that
name within your area.
~


104 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength etcetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

103 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow <site>
Syntax: ban   <site>
Syntax: ban

'BAN <site>' prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  'ALLOW <site>' removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu', all
sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site ban
list is cleared.
~

102 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK NEWLOCK NUMLOCK~
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown
Syntax: wizlock
Syntax: numlock <number>
Syntax: newlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used to
control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow old
connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players below
level immortal without a special bit set may not log in.  Players who lose
their links, however, may reconnect.

NUMLOCK shows at which character level and below may not log in.

NUMLOCK <number> sets which character level and below MAY NOT log in.
Players level immortal and above with a special bit set MAY log in.
Players who lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NEWLOCK is a shortcut to NUMLOCK 1.  NEWLOCK will turn on numlock but
not turn off if currently set.
~

103 DENY DISCONNECT FREEZE~
Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>
Syntax: freeze     <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from
within the game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory
may repeal a DENY by editing the appropriate player file.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

103 SUBZ~
Translation table for sub-classes (from merc.h)

SUB_CLASS_NONE               0           CLASS_MAGE             0

~


-1 WAR WARRIOR~
The WARRIOR class is the most basic fighting class available.  Their
battle training along with high strength and high hit points make them
very formidable in hand to hand combat.  Warriors train in the art of
multiple attacks.  Some master the art of a THIRD ATTACK and if
experienced enough, master a FOURTH ATTACK.  Along with this training in
multiple attacks, a warrior is trained in making each hit count.  ENHANCED
DAMAGE is available to only the learned.  Toward the defence side of the
WARRIOR, skills of PARRY, RESCUE and BASH DOOR allow them to ward off
attacks, rush to the aid of fellow comrades, and open doors rather
barbarously.

Warriors are not able to use scrolls, wands or staves.

DD has a class structure whereby at level 30 you may specialise into one
of three sub-classes.  The warrior sub-classes are as follows:

    THUG                  WARRIOR                 KNIGHT

See 'HELP THUG' and 'HELP KNIGHT' for more information.
~

-1 CLE CLERIC~
The CLERIC class is a spell-casting class devoted primarily toward defence.
The cleric's god gives them spells in the curing, warding, and protection
disciplines.  Clerics being of a defensive nature fare averagely in the art
of mortal combat.  They much prefer to be civil servants to society or
healers to their comrades in arms.

DD has a class structure whereby at level 30 you may specialise into one
of three sub-classes.  The choices for clerics are as follows:

    TEMPLAR                 CLERIC                  DRUID

See 'HELP TEMPLAR' and 'HELP DRUID' for more information.
~

-1 MAG MAGE MAGIC-USER 'MAGIC USER'~
The MAGE class is a spell-casting class devoted primarily toward control
over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power the mage
taps into to influence the world.  Mage spells are devoted to the
invoking, hermetic, and combative disciplines.  Mages fare a little better
than their cleric counterparts in hand-to-hand combat though they much prefer
to stand back and roast their enemies with a FIREBALL.

Mages are not able to use shields or wear anything on their hands, as it
restricts their casting ability.

DD has a class structure whereby at level 30 you may specialise into one
of three sub-classes.  The mage sub-classes are as follows:

    NECROMANCER              MAGE                WARLOCK

Note:  Mages will be a difficult class for inexperienced players.
^^^^^
See 'HELP NECROMANCER' and 'HELP WARLOCK' for more information.
~

-1 THI THIEF~
The THIEF class can be characterized as a warrior who dropped out of
school to pursue more "profitable" means of living.  These wily persons
have physical endurance slightly less than that of a warrior but are much
more agile.  Whereas a warrior uses well placed weapon slashes, a thief
seeks to DISARM his opponent. Thieves  also excel in the art of stealth.
An unwary opponent might not detect a thief until a BACKSTAB is attempted.
To achieve success in this, the skills SNEAK and HIDE are learned.  With the
PICK LOCK and POISON WEAPON skills, a THIEF also makes the perfect
assassin for political power-houses.

Thieves are unable to use shields, as it restricts their movement.

DD has a class structure whereby at level 30 you may specialise into one
of three sub-classes.  The thief sub-classes are:

            NINJA             THIEF           BOUNTY HUNTER

Note:  Thieves will be a difficult class for inexperienced players.
^^^^^
See 'HELP NINJA' and 'HELP BOUNTY HUNTER' for more information.
~

-1 PSI PSIONICS PSIONICIST~
The PSIONICIST class is a spell-casting class similar to mages and clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a cleric's comes
from his or her god, the psionicist derives all of his or her power
from within.  The psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural
forces which infuse his or her own being.  As a result, many of the
devotions that a psionicist can practice are strictly personal in effect,
and cannot be used on other players.

Psionics are unable to use head gear, as it interferes with their mental
powers.

DD has a class structure whereby at level 30 you may specialise into one
of three sub-classes.  The psionic sub-classes are:

          SATANIST              PSIONIC               WITCH

Note:  Psionicists will be a difficult class for inexperienced players.
^^^^^
See 'HELP SATANIST' and 'HELP WITCH' for more information.
~


0 ADRENALIN CONTROL'~
Syntax: cast 'adrenalin control'

By controlling the production and release of adrenalin in his or her
system, the psionicist can gain temporary boosts in dexterity and
constitution.  This control cannot be initiated during battle because,
hey, even psionicists get a little excited from time to time.
~

0 AGITATION~
Syntax: cast 'agitation' <target>

This skill is nearly identical to the Mage spell BURNING HANDS.  With this
skill, a psionicist can cause the cells in his or her victim to become
agitated, moving so fast as to cause burn damage.
~

0 AWE~
Syntax: cast awe <target>

With this discipline, a skilled psionicist can use the power of his or her
mind to affect the morale of an opponent.  If successful, the enemy will
be overcome by awe for the psionicist, and will simply forget to fight.
Of course, aggressive monsters will revert to their true nature after only
a brief lull in the action.
~

0 'BALLISTIC ATTACK'~
Syntax: cast 'ballistic attack' <target>

BALLISTIC ATTACK lets a psionicist use the powers of his or her mind to
throw small objects, usually a rock or other debris that happens to be in
the area, at the target.  The results can be rather amusing to the
psionicist, and painful to the victim.
~

0 'BIOFEEDBACK'~
Syntax: cast 'biofeedback'

BIOFEEDBACK is the power with which a psionicist controls the flow of
blood through his or her body.  This control allows the psionicist to
reduce bleeding, as well as cushion blows against him or her, effectively
reducing the damage by half.  Mind over body indeed...
~

0 'CELL ADJUSTMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'cell adjustment'

A skilled psionicist can also perform CELL ADJUSTMENT, which can remove
poisons from his or her body.  CURSES are also removed.
~

0 'COMBAT MIND'~
Syntax: cast 'combat mind'

A psionicist using COMBAT MIND has a very keen understanding of his or her
enemies and their fighting tactics.  As a result, the psionicist has an
increased chance of hitting his or her enemies, and knows how to minimize
the damage received from their blows.  Because psionicists are telepathic,
this knowledge can also be shared with the his or her companions.
~

0 'CONTROL FLAMES'~
Syntax: cast 'control flames' <target>

With this skill, a psionicist can will the flames in his or her light
source to leap out and strike an enemy.  And if you don't think your light
source uses a flame, well, you're wrong.  You just aren't looking close
enough.
~

0 'DEATH FIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'death field'

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionics
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repercussion.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in
the room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its
deadly touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it. Should the saving
throw fail, the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a
sufficiently different level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the
attack and only take minor damage.
~

0 DETONATE DISINTEGRATE~
Syntax: cast 'detonate'     <character>
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <character>

With both of these skills, a psionicist uses his or her mind to affect the
latent energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough
to the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason,
most psionicist choose the victim itself as the target, since there's
bound to be SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.  Mid-level psionicists
can DETONATE objects on their victim, and extremely skilled psionicists
can even DISINTEGRATE their victims, killing them instantly.
~

0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' DISPLACEMENT 'FLESH ARMOR' 'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'
Syntax: cast  displacement
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in
place by the psionicist's will.

DISPLACEMENT makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her
actual position, thus making him or her more difficult to hit.

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin
into an armor-like substance.

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the
other members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

INERTIAL BARRIER creates a barrier of positive energy that reduces the
damage inflicted by creatures of negative energy.
~

0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <character>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well,
he or she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by
bringing up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.
This lack of confidence can significantly reduce their battle
effectiveness.
~

0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~

0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' <object>

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of
objects, making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious
applications to armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a
psionicist cannot rearrange its molecules.
~

0 'MIND THRUST' 'INFLICT PAIN' 'PSYCHIC CRUSH' 'PSIONIC BLAST' ULTRABLAST~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust'   <character>
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <character>
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <character>
Syntax: cast  ultrablast     <character>

With these skills, a psionicist can telepathically cause damage to the
neural synapses of his or her victim.  The devotions are listed in
increasing order of damage inflicted.
~

0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <character>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or
her own expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~

0 'PROJECT FORCE'~
Syntax: cast 'project force' <character>

If a psionicist successfully PROJECTS FORCE, the force of his or her mind
will strike against the victim's body, causing moderate damage.
~

0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <character>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~

0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the
psionicist does not become too weak.
~

-1 HUMAN~
Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
citizens in the Domain.  Although they have no special talents like the
other races, they are more versatile, being skilled in all the classes.
They are neither particularly weak in any manner nor are they particularly
strong in any respect.
~

-1 ELF~
The Elven race has been around for a long time, if not the longest.  This
race is famous for being excellent archers as well as magicians, however
they do not grow very strong due to their small and often times fine bone
structure.  The tracking abilities of Elves, due to their INFRAVISION and
extraordinary movement regeneration, are legendary.  Elves make good spell
casters, rangers and thieves.
~


-1 WILD-ELF WILDELF~
Wild-elves are tall, strong yet nimble, and handsome beings in a wild way.
Although not as wise or intelligent as elves, they are more suited to
roguish arts and hand to hand combat. Wild elves are a good choice for
thieves and warrior types, and generally suit most classes.
~

-1 ORC~
The orcs are a brutal and savage race of warriors exhibiting strength and
stamina during battle.  They are naturally skilled in hand to hand combat
making them very dangerous adversaries.  Although they do not exhibit much
intelligence never under estimate an orc.  Orcs are a good choice for any
of the warrior classes.
~

-1 SATYR~
The satyr is a half-man, half-goat.  They like to drink wine and party and
tend to lead many a traveller astray.  The satyr makes for a good all round
character and suits most classes.
~

-1 OGRE~
The ogres are a race of combat bred warriors; they are strong, sturdy and
semi-dexterous which makes for an even more agile combatant with a good
regeneration rate.  Like the giant, the ogre does not make a very good
spell caster but make a good selection for all fighting classes.
~

-1 GOBLIN~
Short with a tough leathery yellow skin, and mesmerized by jewels and
small intricate treasures made of fine precious metals, these durable
little people do not have the outright strength as most of the feared
warrior races.  However, they make up for it with mental ability, making
them a good selection for spell casters.
~

-1 HALF-DRAGON HALFDRAGON~
Considered the most feared of the Domain, the half-dragon has to be the
most respected of all creatures that inhabit the realm.  The powerful
wings of the half-dragon enable them to take FLIGHT and they are also able
to protect themselves from breath attacks.  With their strength and agility
they make excellent warriors but never underestimate the half-dragon's
clerical spell casting ability.
~

-1 HALFLING~
Halflings are extremely secretive races; slim and agile, they have
incredibly fast reflexes.  While not being strong they make up for it in
their ability to BLIND their enemies; being shifty by nature they are able
to conceal their movements from innocent bystanders.  Halflings are much
like tiny humans, usually about 3-4 feet in height.  They resemble children
in their appearance and are often mistaken as such by unknowing humans.  They
are extremely quick and tend to make great thieves.
~

-1 DWARF~
Dwarves have a long history associated with their race.  The typical dwarf
is short, bad tempered and likes to drink a lot; they usually have big
beards and a fondness for gold and metals.  The dwarves learn to fight
from an early age and are sturdy and strong.  Dwarves make a good choice
for all warrior classes.
~

-1 CENTAUR~
Half man half horse this race is both strong and agile.  With their powerful
rear leg muscles this race is able to deliver quite a blow from those sharp
hooves.  With the spell SHIELD to help along with their inherent agility they
are often quite hard to hit in combat.  Centaurs cannot use mounts.  Centaurs
are versatile and make a good choice for most classes.
~

-1 DROW~
The drow are the descendants of the elves and are commonly known as the
'dark elves'.  They are elegant and very magically inclined.  They don't
like the sun and usually have purplish/grey skin.  Quick reflexes and a
keen mind are the hallmark of most drow.  The drow makes a good choice for
all spell casting classes and make fair thieves.
~

-1 TROLL~
As a race that has grown up in conflicts and war, the trolls are
powerfully built fighting machines.  Trolls also have an incredible
regeneration rate, as they have an inherent ability to regenerate wounds.
Although trolls lack the the mental ability for a spell caster they make
an excellent choice for all warrior classes.
~

-1 ALAGHI~
The alaghi are a beast race, exhibiting great strength and combat
abilities.  The alaghi are large in size and very tough. As a race with
very little patience they sometimes work themselves into such a frenzy
that they go BERSERK.  The alaghi make good choices for fighting classes.
~

-1 HOBGOBLIN~
Hobgoblins are slow and lazy, tending to run to fat when left to their own
devices.  Due to their physical slowness they have naturally evolved the
defensive capability of TELEPORTing out of danger.  Hobgoblins are short
in stature, even smaller than dwarves, rarely cresting four feet. However,
like the dwarf they exhibit unusual strength and stamina making up for the
mental strength they lack.  Hobgoblins make good warrior types and useful
thieves.
~

-1 YUAN-TI YUANTI~
The Yuan-ti are a snake-like race, and not much is known of them.  It is
rumoured that the yuan-ti are the result of mutating experiments on humans
as they are similar in build to humans.  Yuan-ti are very versatile and
make good choices for all classes.
~

0 BALANCE DEPOSIT WITHDRAW COINS BANK~
Syntax: balance
Syntax: deposit  <amount> <coin type>
Syntax: deposit  all      <coin type>
Syntax: deposit  all
Syntax: withdraw <amount> <coin type>

These commands are used at banks to deposit and withdraw cash.

BALANCE displays your current bank balance, broken down into the different
available coin types.

DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW allow you to deposit into and withdraw money from
your bank account.  You can 'DEPOSIT ALL' and 'DEPOSIT ALL <coin type>'.

The DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW commands will only work when you are inside a
BANK.  When you DEPOSIT money, it will be converted into the different coin
types automatically, enabling you to convert large amounts of lesser value
coins into smaller numbers of larger amount coins.

All prices of items and other amounts in DD are based on the copper coin
(e.g. if the baker sells a pie for 9 coins, it is worth 9 coppers).

The available coin types and their values are:
    copper     =     1 coin
    silver     =    10 copper
    gold       =   100 copper
    platinum   =  1000 copper
~

0 POUCH BELTPOUCH~

The POUCH is your MOST prized possession. The reason is that it is the
ONLY way that you can use items when in combat.  When fighting, you will
have no access to anything in your inventory or anything that you pick up
when in combat, except for what is in your pouch.  The only exception to
this rule is when you have the AUTOWIELD config option enabled, which will
wield a weapon that is picked up while in combat (normal class item
restrictions apply).

Your pouch can contain POTIONS, PILLS and PAINTS and is limited in how many
it can carry.

To use items in combat, you must PUT them into your pouch BEFORE you enter
combat.  You will not be able to add items to your pouch after combat has
started.
~

Immortals will still be able to send TELLs to you, however.  You can use
REPLY if you have tellmode set, too.
~

0 HERO~
The rank of HERO is one of the highest honours in the Dragons Domain.  Once
you achieve level 100 in the Dragons Domain, you are considered a HERO and
cannot level any more.  There is no remorting in the Dragons Domain.

To see the list of characters who have reached level 100, the syntax is HERO.

There are many benefits to being a hero:

Heroes can communicate on the IMMTALK channel, which can be accessed only by
heroes and immortals.  ':' is a synonym for IMMTALK.

NEWBIE CHANNEL

NEWBIE channel to enable them to give something back to the game.  See HELP
NEWBIE for more information.

RENAME
Syntax: rename <object> <string> <value>
Heroes are able to RENAME their equipment.  The strings that can be changed
are: name, short, long, ed (ed being the extra description on the item).

containers.  This includes their own characters.

HOLYLIGHT
Syntax: holylight (toggle)
HOLYLIGHT acts as a permanent detect invis and detect hidden for heroes.

HERO ROOM
Heroes can choose, for a fee of 1000 platinum, to create a room in the
Millionaire's Club in Draagdim.  If you would like to use this service, take a
look at the other hero rooms in the Club, then speak to Hestia.  You will need
to provide a description of the room and a room name.

HERO DESCRIPTION
Heroes can also choose to change the description of themselves that players in
the same room as them see.  Ask an Immortal if you wish to do this.


In addition, heroes do not get hungry or thirsty, and gain access to some
special "hero quest" areas that contain items only available for heroes.
~


0 HERO LEGEND PKILLERS~
Syntax: legend
Syntax: pkillers
Syntax: pkillers <clan name>

LEGEND is similar to FAME in that it shows who has received the most fame
within the Dragons Domain.  The difference between LEGEND and FAME is that
the you will not lose your LEGEND status when your FAME decreases.

PKILLERS without a clan name will show you a list of character pkills and
their pkill scores.  Scores will vary in the number of points allocated
when you pkill characters who are higher levels than you.  Who will top the
individual pkillers table? The challenge is on!  Type 'PKILLERS 2' to see
the second half of the table.

PKILLERS with a clan name will show the top pkillers for that clan.  No
individuality here as it is a team effort to get your clan to the top and
keep it there!

0 ADVICE~
Syntax : advice <skill, spell or knowledge group>

A teacher is able to give limited advice on skills that they can practice.
Advice can be given on any skill that you have learned and the teacher can
teach.

The teacher will give you advice on whether there are benefits in learning
a skill in terms of pre-reqs that it may meet for other skills. This
applies for the current teacher and will change as you get to more
knowledgable teachers.

As an example, if you get advice where the teacher says there are no long
term benefits then he cannot help you get a pre-req with that skill. This
doesn't mean that skill doesn't give a pre-req, it means the teacher can't
get you to it IF it exists.
~

~

0 TEACHER~

Any mob which is capable of helping a character practice is considered a
teacher.  Teachers may be any mob on the mud.  As a general rule teachers
will not be aggressive.

The initial teacher for a newbie will be the Loremaster in mud school.
This is the only teacher who will have sufficient patience to teach low
level characters.  As a character advances, more advanced teachers will
become available.  Such teachers will generally be located within major
towns.  However, specialised or unique skills may be taught by only one
mob in the realms.  Teachers are capable of giving advice (see'HELP
ADVICE').

Having trouble finding teachers?  See 'HELP TEACHER CLUES'.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train [str|int|wis|dex|con]

The physical attributes of a character increase automatically with level.
Every even level (2, 4, 6 ...) a character gains, an attribute is raised,
determined by the train command.

Initially, the attribute which will advance first is the prime requisite
of the character's class.  Once an attribute reaches its maximum value, it
will no longer advance.  If a new attribute is not selected prior to the
next advance it defaults to the prime requisite, then to random order.

The attribute to be trained can be set at any time by typing 'TRAIN
<attribute>'.  Type TRAIN to see what you will attempt to train next.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax:  practice
Syntax:  practice <skill>

PRACTICE without an argument will list all the skills a character can
currently learn and those they currently know.

With an argument, a character will attempt to gain knowledge of that skill
from a teacher (who must be in the same room).  Whether the character
succeeds in learning or not depends on a unique pre-requisite system.
Each skill which a character may learn requires ability in related
knowledge and skills.  For example, cure serious wounds will require
proficiency in cure light wounds and healing knowledge.  Each skill has
associated knowledge areas which must be learnt.  A skill may have more
than one skill or area of knowledge associated with it.

When a character levels, he is allocated practices for that level.  There
are two types of practice: physical and intellectual.  A character's
attributes affects how many of each practice point is gained.  Physical
practices are used to practice skills which depend on brute strength and
co-ordination, such as climb, enhanced damage, second attack, pick locks
and morph.  Intellectual skills encompass spells, areas of knowledge and a
few skills.

The amount of physical practices you gain is dependant on your strength,
wisdom, and dexterity.  Intellect practices are dependant on wisdom and
intelligence.  Users of magic automatically get more intellect practices
than non-magic classes.

How much you learn depends on
      * Your current Wisdom and Intelligence for int pracs, and your
            current Intelligence, Strength and Dexterity for phys pracs.
      * How well the teacher knows the spell/skill.  (Some teachers know
            more than others.)
      * The difference between the teachers knowledge and your current
            knowledge in that spell/skill.  (The more you know, the slower
            you learn).

Practices do NOT accumulate from level to level.  When a character
advances in level, any remaining physical practices become extra hit
points and intellectual practices become mana, on a 1:1 ratio.  The amount
of practices a character gains upon levelling depends on physical
attributes and intellectual attributes respectively.

For more info on practicing see 'HELP TEACHER' and 'HELP ADVICE'; also see
the relevant section in the FAQ ('HELP FAQ').

The combo skill lets the martial artist combo together up to four of his
skills in one attack round.  Only the skills that the Martial Artist gets
are able to be used.  Those skills are:

        ATEMI   SHUTO   KANSETSU   TETSUI   YOKOGERI   MAWASIGERI

Individual help entries exist for these skills.

In order to combine two, three or four moves, you must have learned the
skills COMBO2, COMBO3 or COMBO4.

E.g.    combo atemi shuto yokogeri

Some combos are more effective than others.  Hand strikes can leave
opponents vulnerable to a follow-up attack.  Successive strikes can also
produce extra damage.  You won't be able to kick twice in a row during a
combination.

You will need to experiment in order to find the most effective
combinations.
~

0 ATEMI~
Syntax: atemi

This skill makes a quick strike toward your victim.  It is the most
standard of the Martial Artist skills, and hence will cause only
moderate damage.
~

0 KANSETSU~
Syntax: kansetsu <victim>

You will attempt an arm lock on your victim by trying this skill. If
successful you will break the victim's arms, causing them to drop any
weapons that they might be holding.  As well as disarming your opponent,
you will inflict moderate damage.
~

0 TETSUI~
Syntax: tetsui <victim>

This can be described as the Hammer Fist technique.  A move requiring
great precision and power, a successful hit will inflict heavy damage.
~

0 SHUTO~
Syntax: shuto <victim>

This can best be described as a Knife hand strike.  Again great
concentration is needed for a successful strike, which will inflict heavy
damage.
~

0 YOKOGERI~
Syntax: yokogeri

The first of the kicks a martial artist can learn, this side kick will, if
successful, cause heavy damage on the unsuspecting foe.
~

0 MAWASIGERI~
Syntax: mawasigeri

This is the most powerful move in the Martial Artists arsenal.  The round
house kick will most certainly do extreme damage if successful.  If
combined in a combo then the effects on the opponent are devastating.
~

0 CHOKE~
Syntax: choke <victim>

A skilled brawler will be able to choke their victim, by placing a choker
hold around the victim's neck.  A choked victim becomes unconscious for a
short time and prone to attack.
~

0 GRAPPLE~
Syntax: grapple <victim>

The grappling technique will enable the brawler to bring his/her victim to
the ground.  The force of this manoeuvre is enough to stun the victim for a
short while, making them more vulnerable to attacks.
~

0 'FLYING HEADBUTT'~
Syntax: flying <target>

A spectacular version of a headbutt, with this skill the experienced
brawler leaps through the air and headbutts their victim.  If successful,
the headbutt stuns the victim for a short while making them vulnerable to
a follow-up attack.
~

0 GOUGE~
Syntax: gouge <victim>

Because the brawlers techniques are under-hand, they have devised a way to
blind their enemies by gouging their eyes out, blinding them.
~

0 PUNCH 'SECOND PUNCH'~
Syntax: punch

Punch will cause the brawler to use his fist in the only means he knows
how.  The SECOND PUNCH is made automatically once learned.
~

0 'BATTLE AURA'~
Syntax: battle

Draw on all your mental and physical strength to put your body in a state
of readiness for battle.  This in effect draws blood away from the
extremities, reducing damage taken, and allowing the brawler to focus more
clearly on the battle, increasing the chances to hit.
~

0 'STEAL STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'steal strength' <victim>

A handy combat tool, this spell allows a Satanist to drain the strength
from a victim, and use it to add to their own strength reserves.
~

0 'HAND OF LUCIFER'~
Syntax: cast 'hand of lucifer' <victim>

A particularly nasty spell, the Satanist summons an evil force from the
depths of Hell itself to encircle the victim, trapping them, so that
escape is not possible.  Those who have seen this force say it looks like
a translucent black hand rising from the ground, some believe it is the
hand of Lucifer himself.
~

0 'STEAL SOUL'~
Syntax: cast 'steal soul' <corpse>

Once a Satanist successfully vanquishes their foe, they may attempt to
capture the soul of the freshly slain.  Of course, this requires a fresh
victims corpse.  If successful, the Satanist uses the soul to revitalise
themselves.
~

0 'SATANIC FURY'~
Syntax: cast 'satanic fury' <victim>

A skilled Satanist can invoke the will of his esteemed master to invoke
damage, pain and suffering on their foes.  This spell will cause damage to
all those who stand in the same room as the caster.
~

0 'DEMON FLAMES'~
Syntax: cast 'demon flames' <victim>

This spell will create the illusion that a Horde of Demons are tormenting
the victim, causing them to become distracted, and fight less effectively.
~

0 'DARK RITUAL'~
Syntax: cast 'dark ritual" <corpse>

This spell allows the satanist to summon their god to consume a corpse for
sacrifice.  Their god rewards the satanist with renewed ecstasy for evil.
~

0 FEAR~
Syntax: cast fear <victim>

One who is fearful, invariably flees. That is the theory behind this
spell.  It will invoke great fear in the eyes of the victim, causing them
to flee from battle.
~

0 DETER~
Syntax: cast deter

This self-only spell will create the illusion that you are not to be
messed with.  It will prevent aggressive monsters from attacking you.
Be warned though, higher level aggressives will easily see through your
guise.
~

0 'GAIAS WARNING'~
Syntax: cast 'gaias warning'

This spell, will make you more astute to your surroundings.  As a result
you will be aware of any threats to your person.  For example, an
attempted BACKSTAB or STUN.
~

0 JOUST~
Syntax: joust <victim>

In the spirit of Chivalry, the greatest of Knights would mount their mighty
horses, and wielding a lance, would charge towards their target and basically
stab their opponent.

This skill can only be used to start the fight and you must have a lance
equipped.  Those not of the centaur race must also be mounted in order
to make the charge.
~

0 DESTRIER~
Syntax: destrier <victim>

This difficult skill requires great strength and control of a mount.  A
skill only known to the greatest KNIGHTS of the land the knight uses their
mount to trample opponents foolish enough to stand before them.

Not only can the mounts hooves cause damage but the victim is also knocked
to the ground and is rendered momentarily helpless.

Knights of the centaur race may destrier without a mount.
~

0 AUCTION~
Syntax: auction
Syntax: auction <item>
Syntax: auction <item> <reserve price in platinum>
Syntax: auction bet <amount in platinum>
Syntax: auction stop

Auction an item.  Any mortals may place bids on the item, and the
character to place the highest bid will receive the item for that amount
of platinum coins.

To auction an item, enter 'AUCTION <item>'.  The item must be in your
inventory, and you must also have an auction ticket (tickets are sold in
town).

The 'reserve price' is the minimum bid allowed on the item.  To indicate a
reserve price, enter 'AUCTION <item> <reserve in platinum coins>'.  If no
reserve is indicated, then a base reserve is automatically calculated.
This base reserve is also the minimum reserve that can be set.

Once an item has been offered for sale, you can type 'AUCTION' to see the
item's properties and how much has been bid on it.

Auction betting is done solely with platinum coins.  To place a bet, type
'AUCTION BET <bid in platinum coins>'.  There are a number of shortcuts
available for placing bets:

    To bet a certain percentage above the current bet, type 'AUCTION BET
        +<percentage>', e.g. 'AUCTION BET +30'.

    To bet a certain multiple of the current bet, type 'AUCTION BET
        *<number>', e.g. 'AUCTION BET *3'.

    To bet a large amount, you can use 'k' to indicate thousands of coins.
        E.g. 'AUCTION BET 17k4' bets 17,400 platinum.

When you place a bet, the money will be removed from your bank account if
you have a large enough balance, or from your person if not.  Money
received for selling an item by auction goes straight to your bank account.

Immortals may cancel an auction with 'AUCTION STOP'.
~

0 'SUMMON AVATAR'~
Syntax: cast 'summon avatar'

This Werewolf spell can only be cast in combat.  It summons a mighty wolf
to aid you in your battle.  The wolf will immediately rescue you for a few
rounds.
~

0 KNOCK~
Syntax: cast knock <door or direction>

This spell will let the caster attempt to unlock a door via magical means.
By focusing their powers on the door, they will often invoke the lock
mechanism to unlock itself.
~

0 'RESIST MAGIC'~
Syntax: cast 'resist magic'

This self only spell will improve the chances of saving versus magical
attacks.  The affect of saving will mean that any offensive spells will
cause half-damage, and any charm type spells will fail.
~

-1 BRAWLER BRA~
The BRAWLER is a rough breed of class.  Preferring to do away with weapons
and fight with their bare hands, some would laugh at this breed of
pugilist.  However those who laugh often find themselves on the wrong end
of a PUNCH, HEADBUTT or KICK.  Brawlers with SNAP NECK are feared, and
their WHIRLWIND attack can put them in a mad fighting frenzy.

Brawlers cannot use weapons or wear shields.  The reasons are obvious.
Nor can they use wands or staves.

DD has a class structure whereby at level 30 you may specialise into one
of three sub-classes.  The sub-classes for brawlers are as follows:

          MONK            BRAWLER           MARTIAL ARTIST

Note:  Brawlers will be a difficult class for inexperienced players.
^^^^^
See 'HELP MONK' and 'HELP MARTIAL ARTIST' for more information.
~

-1 SHAPESHIFTER 'SHAPE SHIFTER' SFT~

The SHAPE-SHIFTER is a Mystical class that relies on its abilities to
change shape into a number of different forms in order to survive.  In
CHAMELEON FORM for example, the shifter remains hidden from view with
permanent SNEAK and HIDE.  CAT FORM provides extra senses, while BEAR and
TIGER FORMS create powerful offensive characters.

Each form has limitations in wearing equipment.

DD has a class structure whereby at level 30 you may specialise into one
of three sub-classes.  The choices for shape-shifters are as follows:

        WEREWOLF          SHAPE SHIFTER           VAMPIRE

See 'HELP WEREWOLF' and 'HELP VAMPIRE' for more information.
~

0 MORPH~
Syntax: morph <form>

This skill is the ability that lets you change from one form to another.
E.g. if you wanted to change to Hawk Form, simply type 'MORPH HAWK'.  To
change back into normal form, type 'MORPH NORMAL'.  It is possible (and
sometimes recommended) to morph during combat.
~

0 'MORPHING KNOWLEDGE'~
This group covers the knowledge required to Morph into any of the Forms
available to you.  The more you know, the more forms become available.
~

0 'CHAMELEON FORM'~

The Chameleon Form is useful if you want to disappear.  It has been known
that Shape Shifters knowledgeable in this area are able to remain in
constant sneak AND constant hide!
~

0 'HAWK FORM'~
This form allows you to FLY.
~

0 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word' <victim>

A powerful clerical attack spell in which the cleric, using the power of
their religion, inflicts pain upon their enemy.  Evil opponents suffer
twice the damage that non-evil enemies do.
~

0 'CAT FORM'~

Cats have a major advantage over other forms.  Their senses are very
sensitive to their surroundings.  Thus the more you know about CAT Form
the more astute your senses will become.
~

0 'SNAKE FORM'~
A nasty Form at the best of times, being able to COIL, CONSTRICT and even
STRANGLE their victims if knowledgable enough.  Snakes are also able to
swim and breathe underwater.
~

0 COIL~
Coiling around your victim allows you to CONSTRICT and even STRANGLE them.
~

0 CONSTRICT~
This snake form combat skill allows you to squeeze the living daylights
out of an opponent.
~

0 STRANGLE~

This snake form skill will attempt to finish a victim off, if you have
coiled around them already.
~

0 'SPIDER FORM'~

The spider form has two weapons in its arsenal: WEB, used to trap a
victim, and VENOM, to poison them.
~

0 WEB~
Syntax: web <victim>

Webbing a victim will surround them in a sticky mesh of web, making
movement difficult, and making fleeing extremely difficult.
~

0 VENOM~
Syntax: venom <victim>

This skill will poison a victim, making sure they do not recover from
wounds that you inflict on them.
~

0 'SCORPION FORM'~

The Scorpion Form of the Shape Shifter must be feared, and for one very
good reason, namely a HUGE barbed Sting!  Pity any poor soul who is on the
end of that!
~

0 'BEAR FORM'~

The Shape Shifter's Bear form is one to be reckoned with.  Equipped with
HUGE CLAWS the BEAR hits the hardest of any of the forms.  Its ability to
FORAGE for food makes them useful when feeling a bit peckish.
~

0 'FORAGE'~

This skill allows the user to find food amongst their natural surroundings.
Note you need to be outside in appropriate terrain to be successful.
~

0 'TIGER FORM'~

The TIGER Form of the ShapeShifter must be feared.  Armed with claws and
VERY sharp teeth, its BITE and MAUL attacks will soon rip anything to
shreds.
~

0 'WOLF FORM' 'DIREWOLF FORM'~
Werewolves are able to assume WOLF FORM to gain powerful WOLFBITE and
RAVAGE attacks.  Their senses become extremely sensitive; nothing escapes
their detection.

Werewolves are also acutely sensitive to the full moon: they will be
driven into a frenzy by it, prone to go BERSERK, and inflicting increased
damage.

Powerful lycanthropes become DIREWOLVES: huge, strong wolves much larger
and more terrifying than normal wolves.
~

0 MAUL~

This shifter only skill will soon rip an opponent to threads.  Some have
seen shifters get nine consecutive attacks in a single MAUL.
~

0 RAVAGE~

When in wolf form, a Werewolf can RAVAGE their opponents to inflict many
horrible wounds.  As many as nine consecutive attacks can be landed by the
enraged wolf.
~

0 BITE WOLFBITE~
Syntax: bite
Syntax: wolfbite <target>

A tiger's BITE or the werewolf's WOLFBITE is a feared attack. Let a TIGER
or WOLF sink its powerful jaws into anything, and the reason will become
obvious.
~

0 HOWL~
Syntax: howl <target>

The blood-curdling HOWL of the wolf can terrify, reducing victims to
quivering wrecks incapable of action.
~

0 'RESIST TOXIN'~

Improve your resistance to being poisoned.  This skill is used
automatically once learned.
~

0 FOCUS~
Syntax: focus <target>

Focus allows a skilled player to shift the focus of their attacks if being
attacked by more than one enemy at once.  This is very useful in groups as
it will let the player concentrate on the enemy that is most dangerous.
~

0 SUCK~
Syntax: suck <target>

This Vampire skill attempts to suck the blood from a victim.  A successful
attack will cause damage to the victim, while increasing the blood points
of the Vampire.
~

0 FEED~

corpse, extracting any blood left in it.  Vampires automatically gain
this skill.

time.  A highly useful skill, especially when confronted with lots of
aggressive enemies.
~

0 FORGE SHARPEN~
Syntax: sharpen <weapon>
Syntax: forge   <armor>

SHARPEN will increase the deadliness of certain weapons.

FORGE will increase the armor class on most items of armor.

NOTE: Sharpening a weapon or forging armor will cause it to deteriorate
quicker, hence the life of the weapon is reduced greatly.  The '(Damaged)'
flag will appear on these items as their condition deteriorates.
~

0 PUSH~
Syntax: push <target> <direction>

This skill will enable you to push an enemy or player out of the room you
are currently in.
~

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This skill will let you ride on some poor beastie, saving you energy and
movement points.  Those of the centaur race may not use mounts.

DISMOUNT will obviously get you off your ride.  You do not need to
practice dismount.

Note that to prevent maltreatment of creatures, a creature has to have a
'<Mount>' flag in order to be mounted.
~

0 'SNAP NECK' 'BREAK WRIST'~
Syntax: snap
Syntax: break

SNAP NECK will attempt to do just that, snap the neck of your victim.
This will only work if you have sufficiently wounded your opponent first.

BREAK WRIST will break the wrists of your opponent.  If they are wielding
a weapon, it will fall to the ground.

A werewolf's rage defines how likely they are to lose all self-control,
and berserk in combat.  The more the werewolf kills, the less likely they
will berserk in combat.  Rage also decreases if a werewolf is in normal
form.
~

0 'FLY FORM'~

One of the most difficult forms to master, the humble fly may seem puny
but its uses are many.  Being so small, it poses no threat to any creature
in the Domain.  Of course its lack of size means that it cannot carry

Doors.  Of course this only applies to doors who have locks!  You will
not experience hunger or thirst while in fly form.
~

any form.  Its immunity to fire has much benefit in battle, as well as the
fact they can summon minor devils to aid them, makes them feared.

The Griffin is a cross between a lion, and the mighty eagle.  The form
gets the benefit of both flight and the awesome attacking ability of the

0 'PKILL RULES' 'PK RULES'~

The level limits (enforced by the server) for pkill are:

 < 20  : Pkill prohibited
 20-30 :  5 levels
 31-50 : 10 levels
 51-99 : 25 levels*
 100   : 5 levels*

* In clan HQs there is no level restriction for targets level 51+.

You may have multiple characters logged in during a pkill but any other
characters you have logged MUST be in either the Midgaard or Anon Temple
or at a quest master.  You may not use more than one of your own characters
in the fight.  This includes casting spells, trapping, etc... with one
character then killing with another. Clanned players may not have more than
one of their OWN characters out in the field for any reason at any time. See
also HELP MULTIPLAY.

It is legal for two or more separate players to pkill one person.

You may not spam kill.  Spam killing is ATTACKING a character that you have
killed before and they have not gained 5 levels since you last killed them.
This rule is to protect passive or inexperienced characters.  This rule does
not apply to characters who have a {R0{x or positive final pkill score, as
shown in their WHOIS information.

By joining a clan, you agree to these rules and will play by them where
the mud does not enforce them.

Please refer any pkill related issues to the Immortals via your clan leader.

See also HELP 'PKILL SCORE'
~

0 'PKILL SCORE' 'PK SCORE'~

Pkill scores are calculated on the level difference between the two characters
involved in the pkill:

Level difference                        Pkill points
Victim 6 levels or more below pkiller   1
Victim 5-3 levels below pkiller         2
Victim 2-1 levels below pkiller         3
Victim 0 to 4 levels above pkiller      3
Victim 5 to 9 levels above pkiller      5
Victim 10-14 levels above pkiller       7
Every additional 5 levels...            2 extra points

Once you have a few pkills under your belt, your pkill score is one reflection
of how successful you are. Killing people around your own level most of the
time will give you an average of 2-3 points per kill. Above or below this is
some indication of how successful you are. If you see someone with a lot of
kills and a high rating (see below), watch out!

You can find out which pkillers have the most points by viewing the pkill
score table (type PKILLERS). This table lists the top 20 pkillers, the number
of people they have killed and the number of points they have gained. Also
included is their 'rating', calculated from the average number of points
gained per kill. The ratings, from highest to lowest, are: Slayer, Predator,
Assassin, Hunter, Stalker, Brigand, and Coward. Killing people your level will
give you a rating of Stalker.

opponents causing moderate damage.

them into a frenzy, and makes their impressive scaly hide harder to
penetrate and damage.

PATTERN SET creates a temporary pattern at the casters current location.

PATTERN RETURN returns the caster to their created temporary location.  The
act of returning also destroys the temporary pattern point.

-1 RANDOM ATTRIBUTES STRENGTH INTELLIGENCE WISDOM DEXTERITY CONSTITUTION~

Five attributes define the physical and mental qualities of your character:

  {WStrength{x      {d({x{wStr{d){x  Physical power; affects damage inflicted in combat,
                         lifting of heavy items and how much may be carried.

  {WIntelligence{x  {d({x{wInt{d){x  Mental capabilities, cleverness; affects how quickly
                         new skills are learned and the casting of spells.

  {WWisdom{x        {d({x{wWis{d){x  Spiritual development; affects bonuses gained after
                         levelling and the casting of spells by Clerics.

  {WDexterity{x     {d({x{wDex{d){x  Agility and nimbleness; affects combat bonuses.

  {WConstitution{x  {d({x{wCon{d){x  Physical health and stamina; affects hit point
                         bonuses.

Characters start with randomly generated attributes that are modified by
their class and race.  The attributes you should choose depends on your
chosen class: fighting types need strength, constitution and dexterity; spell
casting types need intelligence and wisdom.

You can re-roll your attributes as many times as you wish.  Try rolling a few
times first to see the range of scores available to your character.

finding and utilising herbs, and remaining undetected.  Rangers are
also skilled bowmen, able to SHOOT and cause terrible damage.

earn even more favour from their God, and their FRENZY is gradually
improved.
~

the thug out of fear.  This skill requires intense concentration on behalf
of the thug and can not be kept up very long.

and the like.  There is some risk associated with this skill if the
shopkeeper is more powerful than the thug.

    flight
    tranquility
    sustenance
    shadows

~

0 'SONG OF REJUVENATION' REJUVENATION~
Syntax: sing rejuvenation

Many travel-weary bards have found themselves in need of a healer after an

of enterprising bards composed a song which, when sung, gradually heals
the singer back to full health.
~

they have developed a song which prevents unfriendly monsters from

0 'SONG OF SUSTENANCE' SUSTENANCE~
Syntax: sing sustenance

As bards are on the road most of the time, they quite often find
themselves far from a friendly inn when they feel like a cool drink or a
bite to eat.  To combat this, a clever bard wrote a song of sustenance to
stop himself from getting hungry at inopportune times.
~

0 'SONG OF SHADOWS' SHADOWS~
Syntax: sing shadows

A bard can sometimes earn a bad reputation by singing a song that may not
be quite appropriate to the occasion.  Because of this, a skilled bard can
learn to pass unseen when needed.

to identify herbs and other foodstuffs or medicines in their environment.
~

0 GATHER~

of water deep underground, and cause them to well up from the ground.

0 SHOOT 'SECOND SHOT' 'THIRD SHOT' ACCURACY~
Syntax: shoot <target>

prey, catching them unawares and allowing the ranger to inflict a shot of
high damage.  Rangers who have practised ACCURACY can also increase the
amount of damage inflicted by each shot they land.
~

0 THRUST~

open, attack.  Thrusting with their weapon allows the fighter to inflict
heavy damage, but may leave them open for a counter-attack.

0 'MOBILE BODY FORM'~
Mobile 'body form': Information for builders
--------------------------------------------

Summary

'Body_form' is a value we have introduced that describes the morphology
of mobiles, to improve corpse and carnage production upon death, and
prevent some rather silly player:mobile interactions (tripping up snakes,
for example).


Variables

Mobile descriptors contain a numeric 'gold' field that was used by Merc
MUD servers but is not used by Envy servers.  We have assigned this
field to contain the 'body_form' value.  This value contains flags that
describe the physical characteristics of mobiles that are checked by
many functions during the game.

A body_form value of 0 specifies a normal sized humanoid capable of
speech.  Zero will most likely be the default value written to your
area if you are using building software such as MZF.

The following bit values are used to specify mob form (defined in
merc.h):

        Flag              Bit   Legend
        --------------    ---   --------------------------------
        BODY_NO_HEAD        1   No head
        BODY_NO_EYES        2   No eyes
        BODY_NO_ARMS        4   No arms
        BODY_NO_LEGS        8   No legs
        BODY_NO_HEART      16   No heart
        BODY_NO_SPEECH     32   Cannot speak the common language
        BODY_NO_CORPSE     64   Won't leave a corpse when killed
        BODY_HUGE         128   Massive size
        BODY_INORGANIC    256   Not made of living tissue

You may need to manually edit your finished area files to set body_form
values correctly.  The 'gold' field occurs immediately after the
(redundant) hitroll/damroll information:

        #101
        wild dog^
        a wild dog^
        A half starved, wild dog wanders the abandoned street.
        ^
        This wild-eyed and starving mongrel patrols the piles of rubbish.
        ^
        1|32|128 0 0 S
        1 0 0 0d0+0 0d0+0
Here -> 4|32 0
        8 8 1

In this example, the mob 'wild dog' has a body_form value of 36 (no arms
and no speech).  Pipes can be used for easy calculation.  (^ = a tilde,
let's imagine.)


Examples

Here are a few common non-human forms as examples:

        Dogs, cats, horses, livestock        4|32   =    36
        Golems, animated statues        16|32|256   =   304
        Snakes, worms                      4|8|32   =    44
        Ghosts, wraiths, spirits      2|16|64|256   =   336


Corpses

Corpse formation is slightly altered.  Mobs with 'BODY_NO_CORPSE' set
do not form corpses or produce carnage; they wither and disappear.
Any coins or equipment that would normally be in a corpse falls to the
floor of the room.  If equipment or money falls a message is printed
when the mob is killed.

Corpse forming mobiles may produce body parts when killed or spray
blood.  Relevant checks for heads, arms etc are made to prevent wrong
body parts from being produced.  Body parts from mobiles with
'BODY_INORGANIC' set are made type 'trash' and are inedible (but still
have a timer set to prevent clutter).


Remarks

If you have any questions or problems please contact Shade or myself.

0 'CLAN ITEMS'~
Each clan receives four pieces of equipment for use by clan members.  The
first may be used at any level; the second may be used at level 30 and is
worn in the same position as the first item; the third is gained at level
60 and is worn at a different location as the first two items; the fourth
is a belt pouch and is gained at level 50.  The bonuses carried by the
items are chosen by the designers of the clan.  The first item usually has
combat bonuses; the second healing bonuses; and the third combat and
healing bonuses.  The clan belt pouch has a larger capacity and usually
carries a small combat bonus.

Clan leaders should use the command OCLANITEM to load items for clan
members: see HELP OCLANITEM.

Clan items are powerful artefacts and as such are created with the name
of their owner assigned.

See 'HELP CLAN COMMANDS' for a list of additional commands for clan
leaders.
~

0 OCLANITEM~
Syntax: oclanitem <character> <low|mid|high|pouch>

Clan leaders may use OCLANITEM to load clan equipment for fellow clan
members.  You may load any of the four clan items for a player so long as
they are high enough level to receive them.  The items are:

    low          Low-level item         Any level
    mid          Mid-level item         Level 30 or higher
    high         High-level item        Level 60 or higher
    pouch        Clan beltpouch         Level 50 or higher

Clan members should not be carrying more than one of each item they are
able to wear.

1 SAFE~
Syntax: safe

Checks whether you are safe or unsafe from being murdered by other players
at your current location, or whether you are in the arena.  Characters
that are unclanned and not ronin, or below level 15, are always safe from
being pkilled.

You can use the tokens '%s' (personal safety) and '%S' (general safety) in
your prompt: see 'HELP PROMPT'.
~


1 TOURNAMENTS~
Syntax:  tournament [info]        View tournament information and entrants
         tournament enter         Enter the current tournament
         tournament enter <team>  Enter for a particular team
         tournament withdraw      Withdraw from the current tournament

Immortals can run special pkilling 'tournaments' in the Arena for players
to take part in.  The tournament deaths do not count as real pkills, and
no experience is lost, as per a regular arena death.

When a tournament is posted, normal access to the arena is blocked.
Players then get to enter the tournament if they wish to take part.
An Immortal will then start the tournament, whereupon all entrants are
automatically transferred to the Arena to start fighting.  The last person
left alive in the Arena is the winner!  You are automatically disqualified
from the tournament if you leave the Arena by recalling.

To check if a tournament is running and who has already entered, type
TOURNAMENT or 'TOURNAMENT INFO'.  This displays the full list of entrants
and any options that the Immortal calling the tournament has set.  There
are several options.

You can look at this information before, during and after the tournament;
there is also a TOURNAMENT channel that provides running commentary.  (You
should have this channel turned on if you want to enter!)

Type 'TOURNAMENT ENTER' to enter a posted tournament.  You must be within
the level range set by the tournament's poster in order to be accepted.
Type 'TOURNAMENT WITHDRAW' to remove yourself from the tournament if
necessary.

Some tournaments involve two or more teams fighting each other until only
one team is left.  To enter a team tournament, type 'TOURNAMENT ENTER <team
name>', e.g. 'TOURNAMENT ENTER RED' for the Red team.

When it's time to begin, the countdown will be started and you'll be
transferred into the Arena, from where it's up to you to kill your
opponents.  If you are tailing or stalking a victim, that tail or stalk
will be cancelled.  You may not tail or stalk during the tournament.

* You MUST be standing awake and ready at the Temple of Midgaard for the
  transfer, else you will be disqualified and not transported.

Immortals should read 'HELP TOURNAMENT CONTROLS' for details on how to run
tournaments.
~

101 'TOURNAMENT CONTROLS'~
Syntax:  tournament set <open|team|tag> [number teams] <lower level> \
                 <upper level> [noflee] [nowimpy] [noquaff] [sameroom]
         tournament cancel
         tournament close
         tournament start
         tournament ban <character>

There are three types of tournament: 'open', 'team' and 'tag'.  'Open'
tournaments involve all fighters killing each other until one is left.
'Team' tournaments involve 2-4 teams fighting each other until only one
team is left.  'Tag' or 'tag team' tournaments haven't been implemented
yet, sorry!

Post a tournament using the SET command.  If you indicate a team
tournament you must also include the number of teams you want to
participate (2-4).  In a set team tournament, player choose which team
they enter.  If not all the teams you set are filled, the tournament can
still be run so long as there are at least two teams: the empty teams are
deleted.

E.g.     tournament set open ...
         tournament set team 3 ...

You must provide a level range (valid levels are 10-100).  You may add any
number of the following options after the level range:

         noflee        Players may not use the FLEE command
         nowimpy       Players' wimpy values are ignored
         sameroom      Players are all transferred into the same room
         noquaff       Players cannot quaff potions
         nopill        Players cannot eat pills
         nobrandish    Players cannot brandish staves

E.g.     tournament set open   10 100
         tournament set open   30 40 nowimpy noflee
         tournament set team 3 50 60 sameroom

Once you have set a tournament give players time to ENTER.  When you enter
you are listed on 'TOURNAMENT INFO'; nothing else happens until you start
the tournament.  You can cancel a tournament using 'TOURNAMENT CANCEL'.
You can CLOSE a tournament to further entries without starting the
tournament.  You can also BAN players that have entered that you don't
wish to take part.  The ban lasts until the next tournament is posted.
You can not unban players or reopen closed tournaments.

Use START to begin the tournament: there is a countdown shown to the
players and then they are all automatically transferred to the arena.
Players must be awake, not fighting and standing at the Temple of Midgaard
(recall square, 3001) else they will not be transferred.

Tournaments are automatically closed when one player remains in the arena
or all are disqualified.  CANCEL the tournament to unlock the Arena, else
SET a new tournament directly.

Only the Immortal that SETs the tournament may start the tournament.  That
Immortal or any others higher in level may CANCEL the tournament.

You may use the command 'RESTORE TOURNAMENT' to restore all entrants.

0 'BREATHE WATER'~
Syntax: cast 'breathe water'

Allows the caster to remain underwater without beginning to drown.
~

0 'RESIST COLD' 'RESIST HEAT' 'RESIST ACID' 'RESIST LIGHTNING'~
Syntax: cast 'resist <cold|heat|acid|lightning>'

These spells improve the caster's ability to resist elemental attacks,
including spells and breath weapons.  'Resist heat' and 'resist cold' also
protect the caster from extremely hot and extremely cold environments.
~

0 'HELLFIRE' 'HELL FIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'hellfire' <target>

A powerful Satanist may summon forth white-hot fires from the pits of
Hell to sear their victims' flesh from their bones.
~

0 'CHAOS BLAST' 'CHAOSBLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'chaos blast' <target>

A Satanist able to summon chaotic energies from the nether realms may
focus and direct them at a target, inflicting unpredictable amounts
of damage on their foe.  As it requires ignorance on the part of the
victim to be successful, this spell may not be cast on alert or
suspicious opponents.  Additionally, enemies who are trapped or
otherwise rendered immobile are more vulnerable to its depredations.
~

0 REVIEW~
Syntax: review <chat|music|shout|info|tournament|immtalk|dirtalk|clan|newbie>

Review recent communication on many of the MUD's talk channels.  Enter
'REVIEW <channel name>' to list up to twenty broadcast statements.  You
may only review the immtalk and dirtalk channels if you are authorized to
use those channels.  You can only review the clan channel for the clan you
are a member of.  You may only review the newbie channel if you are a newbie
or an immortal or hero.
~

0 'HERO CLUB ROOMS' 'HERO CLUB' 'MILLIONAIRES CLUB'~
Upon reaching HERO, a player may purchase a room in the Draagdim
Millionaire's Club for 1000 platinum coins.  The hero can decorate this
room as they wish.  Please note that items dropped on the ground in these
rooms will not survive reboots, the same as other rooms in the Domain.
Also note, you will still need the Draagdim recall to use your room, it
is not included in the purchase price!  If you are interested in purchasing
a room, talk to Hestia or one of the other Immortals.
~

0 SUICIDE~
Syntax: suicide [code]

Commit suicide: you will die, lose some experience and possibly fame.
Use this command as a last resort if you are hopelessly stuck.

First, you must type SUICIDE to receive a numerical code.  Then type
'SUICIDE <code>' to commit suicide.
~

0 DELETE~
Syntax: delete

To delete your character, type DELETE.  You will be asked for confirmation
that you wish to do this.  Type DELETE again to delete your character and
leave the Dragons Domain, or type DELETE <any argument> to remove your
delete status.

WARNING!  This command is irreversible!  It is not the Imms' responsibility if
you were drunk/your little brother did it/your cat stood on your keyboard/you
wanted to see how it worked/whatever!  Only delete if you are totally sure you
will not want your character or any of its equipment or inventory again.

0 NEWSOCIALS~
So you want to become a part of DD forever and design your own social...
well, that's fine by us so long as it's not completely disgusting :P

Socials are defined by seven lines of text corresponding to seven
different interactions that the social could be used in.  E.g. a social
'wink' could be:

  1.  'wink' as seen by you              E.g. "You wink."
  2.  'wink' as seen by others                "Gezhp winks."
  3.  'wink <target>' as seen by you          "You wink at Milli."
  4.  'wink <target>' as seen by others       "Gezhp winks at Milli."
  5.  'wink <target>' as seen by target       "Gezhp winks at you."
  6.  'wink <self>' as seen by you            "You wink at yourself."
  7.  'wink <self>' as seen by others         "Gezhp winks at himself."

Not every interaction needs to be unique for the social to work.

If you want to include a social, just send a note to IMM with the
social texts in natural English (as in the above example).

Swedish socials will have to pass a rigorous translation process.
