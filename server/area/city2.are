Temple of Jammer~
You are standing a small shrine dedicated to the GOD Jammer.  Soft
music,  seemingly coming from inside your head,  calms you as you
survey this rather plain looking room.  There are statues of various
musical instruments, some easily recognised and others curiously
familiar.  A large word hangs over the doorway leading to the street.
It reads: "Marshall(tm)".  It's meaning escapes you.

small statue of a dwarf holding a small piece of cloth (obviously

to Jihad,  Rufus and Sacrifis.
