about her brilliant, gleaming sword.

This lanky sahuagin is the royal smith, responsible for the armour and weapons

Rani Matenn is a middle-aged female sahuagin, and evidently a fairly important
cleric in the Sekolah-worshipping hierarchy, as she tends the royal temple.

She leads the prayers here, perhaps ironically as Sekolah so rarely pays any
attention to them, despising those weak enough to ask him for help. Still,
can't hurt to ask.

In the opulent harem of the underwater palace, a figure of quiet authority and
unwavering loyalty serves with unmatched dedication. This is the royal sahuagin
eunuch, a guardian and confidant to the sahuagin prince's wives. With a
countenance that is both serene and inscrutable, he moves through the harem with
a grace that belies his formidable presence. His scales shimmer in hues of deep
blue and green, a testament to his distinguished status within the palace.

Tasked with attending to the needs of the prince's wives, he oversees their
well-being, ensuring that their quarters are maintained with the highest
standards of comfort and luxury. His voice, when he speaks, carries the weight
of his responsibility, yet it is always measured, reflecting the respect and
reverence he holds for those under his care.

Despite his powerful position, he carries himself with a humility that endears
him to the inhabitants of the harem. In a world of intrigue and opulence, the
royal sahuagin eunuch stands as a pillar of stability, his loyalty to the prince
and his duty to the prince's wives unwavering.

being of lawful and good alignment, but that this also means they're likely to
be extremely haughty and arrogant. The Triton looks at you irritably, with

Elb'kl Ala prince sahuagin~
Elb'kl Ala, the Prince of Ota'ar Dar~
<248>The largest and most powerful sahuagin you have ever seen stands before you.<0>
~
Prince Elb'kl Ala of Ota'ar Dar stands as a commanding presence, embodying the
fierce majesty and indomitable will of the sahuagin people. His four-armed
baronic physique is a testament to his prowess, with muscular contours and
scales that shimmer in shades of deep blue and emerald green, reflecting the
opulence of the ocean's depths. His eyes, sharp and penetrating, glint with a
refined cunning and shrewdness and the unyielding strength of his lineage.

Adorned in regalia befitting his royal status, Prince Elb'kl Ala wears armor
forged from the rarest undersea metals, embellished with coral and precious gems
sourced from the darkest crevices of the sea. His crown, a masterwork of
craftsmanship, is made of intertwined strands of gold and pearls, symbolizing
his dominion over all sea life and his connection to the ancient magic that
pulses through the waters.

A tactician and warrior, Elb'kl Ala wields a trident of unparalleled power,
said to be starmetal crafted in the fires of underwater volcanoes and cooled in
the deepest trenches. The trident serves not only as a weapon but as a symbol of
his rule, capable of imbuing the wielder with a portion of the ocean's power.

Cruel and cunning, yet formidable in battle, Prince Elb'kl Ala is feared by his
subjects and enemies alike. His voice commands the obedience of the city's
denizens, and his actions shape the fate of the underwater world.

You can't help but notice Elb'kl Ala's face looks somewhat paler than any other
sahuagin you've seen, but given he is so extraordinary in other ways, perhaps
it's nothing to be concerned about.

Carried by the ancient hero Xerces, this blade has many powerful enchantments.
The sword's workmanship is faultless, made of solid steel with a silver handle
and pommel.  Legend has it that Xerces won the sword after defeating the
chimera that guarded the king Hagian's tomb, who had become a powerful lich.
Although gaining favour with several gods, the immortal Ares became jealous
of Xerces' increasing popularity as a great warrior, and sent the Furies to
slaughter him in his sleep.

robes royal eunuch~

The robes worn by the royal eunuch are a blend of functionality and ceremonial
grandeur, reflecting his esteemed position within the underwater court. Crafted
from the finest silk seaweed, these garments flow around him like the currents
of the sea, dyed in shades of deep cerulean and emerald green that complement
his aquatic nature. The fabric is light, allowing him to move with ease and
grace, yet it is resilient, woven with enchantments to resist the wear of water
and time.

Adorning the edges of his robe are intricate patterns of coral and pearl,
meticulously embroidered to signify his royal duties and his close association
with the sahuagin prince's household. The sleeves are long and slightly flared,
designed to billow elegantly as he moves through the water, while a sash of
golden kelp cinches at the waist, a symbol of his rank and service.

At his throat, a clasp in the shape of a sea creature, crafted from precious
metals and studded with jewels, secures the robe. This clasp is not just
decorative; it serves as a badge of his office, denoting his authority and his
role as the guardian of the harem's tranquility. Despite the opulence of his
attire, the robes are devoid of ostentation, embodying the dignity and the
solemn responsibility that the royal eunuch carries in his service to the palace.

 truce certainly can not be preserved indefinitely. We should arrange a face to

Curiously, you find yourself encased in seawater on the drawbridge, while up

it gives way to breathable air.<0>

where most of the smithing work is done, while metal is smelted in the upper
level, and the heat and toxic fumes produced are removed from the area by an
elaborate venting system.

From here you may travel north or east to explore the courtyard further, or

From here, you can explore the courtyard farther west, head east through the
stable gates, or swim directly up, towards the huge, looming area of darkness
in the water above.<0>

Prince's Stables, Lower~
<222>You stand in the lower level of the Prince's stables.  A variety of equipment
used for the care and training of mounts is affixed to the walls of the stables
while various platforms and cages are used to house the plethora of sea beasts
that serve as mounts to the sahuagin.

From here you may exit west, through the stable gates, or explore the stables

<184>Prince's Drawbridge - West, Lower<0>~
<179>You are standing on the western drawbridge leading to the interior courtyard
of the Prince's canton in Ota'ar Dar.  Great gates lie west, leading to the
canal complex, and east, affording entrance to the courtyard itself.
Curiously, you find yourself encased in seawater on the drawbridge, while up
and to the north and south some magical force holds the seawater at bay, and
it gives way to breathable air.<0>

which traverses the air moat, separating the courtyard from the Ota'ar Dar
canal system. To the east are the walls of the Prince's castle, but no entrance
can been seen into them from here.  The courtyard continues north, while the
steady chime of hammer on anvil can be heard coming from the south.

From here, you can explore the courtyard farther north, head west through the

area of darkness in the water above.<0>

generally on its interior decoration. You'd imagine the prince could entertain
several thousand individuals in here, easily.

from across the domain, as he wanted to create a hostile barrier between his
<81>home and the water-breathing races sworn to enmity with the sahuagin. While

The Air Moat~
<74>You are in mid-air in the magical air moat that surrounds the Prince's canton
in Ota'ar Dar, deep underwater.  Long ago, the Prince commissioned mages from
<75>the surface realms to build it and fill it with air-dwelling creatures captured
from across the domain, as he wanted to create a hostile barrier between his
<81>home and the water-breathing races sworn to enmity with the sahuagin. While
clearly sandwiched between the walls of the Prince's courtyard and the outer
<87>wall of the canals, it seems to stretch impossibly into infinity in both up

The Royal Foundry, Upper~
<147>You stand in the upper level of the Royal Foundry belonging to the Ota'ar
Dar Prince.  Weapons and armour for his personal guard are made here, to the
most exacting standards of craftsmanship.  It is a split-level structure, with
this upper level being where most of the metal is smelted and roughly shaped,
before being finished and detailed in the lower level.

Above the forge, you see a large <153>flue<0><147>, whereby the heat and toxic fumes
produced by the forge are removed from the area by an elaborate venting system.

The only obvious exit from here is down, to the lower level of the Foundry.<0>

with scrolls and tomes bound in seaweed and fish skin, containing knowledge
accumulated over centuries.

In the center stands a large, obsidian desk, its surface polished to a mirror
finish, upon which rest various artifacts of power and tools for divination,
including crystal orbs filled with bioluminescent plankton and maps of the
oceanic currents. The room is illuminated by a soft, ambient glow emanating from

lanterns, casting long, sinister shadows across its confines. The walls, adorned
with trophies of the prince's vanquished foes and relics of dark magic, speak to
the lord of Ota'ar Dar's ruthless pursuit of power and dominion.

At the room's center stands a throne made from the bones of a leviathan, its
presence imposing and chilling. Surrounding the throne, various instruments of
torture and enchantment lie scattered, ready to be wielded in the prince's hands.

The water here is cold, as if the warmth of life itself recoils from this place.

Doors lead north, east, and west from here.<0>

The Air Moat~
<74>You are in mid-air in the magical air moat that surrounds the Prince's canton
in Ota'ar Dar, deep underwater.  Long ago, the Prince commissioned mages from
<75>the surface realms to build it and fill it with air-dwelling creatures captured
from across the domain, as he wanted to create a hostile barrier between his
<81>home and the water-breathing races sworn to enmity with the sahuagin. While
clearly sandwiched between the walls of the Prince's courtyard and the outer
<87>wall of the canals, it seems to stretch impossibly into infinity in both up
and down directions.<0>

Prince's Courtyard, Upper~
<136>You are swimming about 4 metres above sandy ground in the courtyard of an
ancient castle, deep underwater. To the west you see high stone walls,
separating the courtyard from the air moat that surrounds it. To the east are
the walls of the castle itself; they afford no entrance from here. South lies
the richly-decorated walls of a building that seems like it serves some sort of
religious function; its entrance lies downwards from here.

You can head north or down from here to explore more of the courtyard, or
straight up, towards the huge, looming area of darkness in the water directly
above you.<0>

<129>You stand in a breathtaking room in an underwater palace, designed to house the
sahuagin prince's harem. The space radiates a serene and majestic beauty,
tailored to the refined tastes of its royal inhabitants. The walls are adorned
with intricate mosaics of pearl and coral, and shimmer with the soft glow of
bioluminescent flora.  You can explore the room to the north and east from
here, while imposing gold and jewel-encrusted doors lead out to a corridor
southward.<0>
