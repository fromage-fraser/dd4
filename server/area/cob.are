-1 COB 'COVEN OF BONE'~
{x
    Ages ago, those who practiced the Dark Arts were hunted and brutally
executed. Those who managed to practice and live did so in extreme secrecy.
Even the cautious practitioners were eventually discovered and slain. For
safety, the necromancers, witches, and others who learned the ways of the Dark
Arts banned together in small groups they called covens. Although these covens
did survive longer than the individuals could, a handful of spell casters
simply could not stand up against the number of soldiers and hunters cities
could send against them. The covens were dispersed and destroyed one by one.
Alenkia, head of the last remaining coven and possibly the most powerful witch
of her time, sat in her underground chamber anticipating the moment the
soldiers would storm their house. Without other option, she decided to use her
dangerous trump card. She began carving a circle in the dirt, then carved
arcane runes along the circumference. After her preparations were complete,
she began chanting. After an hour of chanting, a wind swept through her
chamber and a dark figure came into existence within the circle. The figure
then revealed itself from the shadows. It stood about 7' tall, was completely
covered by its black robe, and wielded an even taller scythe. Alenkia knew of
this creature and recognized it to be the God of Death. Infuriated, Death
screamed, demanding to know the reason for its summoning into the Prime
Material Plane. Alenkia explained the situation calmly, and then asked for the
power to overcome those who sought to destroy the practitioners of the Dark
Arts. Death cackled and explained his offer...

    That night, as expected, the clan house was attacked. A score of
soldiers charged into the tunnel system, swords waving. A single man stood
calmly at the end of the entrance hall. Beside him lay two corpses, those of
other members of the coven. With a chant and a gesture, the corpse rose and
charged at the attackers. Another spell  and the second corpse did the same.
With each soldier slain by the powerful Vampires, a new one was raised. A single
soldier stood out from the group, obviously more experienced and a better
fighter. The fighter managed to fight his way through the crowd and charge at
Alenkia. She threw a single spell and his body twisted to deformity as he
dropped to the ground.

    The newly empowered witch approached the helpless hero, and with a
touch withered what little life was left away from him. That night all were
slain except for one boy who was tortured then allowed free to tell his people
of the power they now stood against. Many would-be bands of soldiers attacked
the coven, but none prevailed. Many other practitioners of the Dark Arts
learned the secrets that Alenkia had, and they now stood as a force to be
reckoned with. The coven eventually dispersed through the generations, but the
legends of their power endured. Rumors that they were simply hiding also
endured. No more covens were ever formed, but every once in a while a
practitioner of the Dark Arts was discovered, but rarely hunted or sought
after.

    Blackbane, the surviving ruler of the long dead Coven of Bone and a
powerful Lich, sat contemplating in his chamber. He decided it was now time to
bring back the legendary Coven of Bone. He informed Ythguan, an illithid lich,
and they searched the realms for those who follow the Dark Arts...

garments have decayed to rags. One prominent symbol still endures the ages on
its primary robe, however.

Blackbane~
Blackbane the Lich stands here motionless.
~
The skin of this lich has completely decayed, leaving nothing but a skeleton.
He has been adorned with many intricate garments and rich jewelry. The weight
of a twisted staff, carved from petrified mushrooms, is held in Blackbane's
hand. You catch a glint off something on his face...upon closer inspection
you realize that several of his teeth have already been replaced with
expensive gems. Several teeth are missing, leaving empty slots. Blackbane
moves suddenly, scaring the hell out of you.

Although a powerful necromancer, he puts his powers of death to use to heal
his fellow coven members. He is a tall, unnaturally thin human. He heals the
injured, and animates those who die under his care. The light color of his
robes covers most shades of gray.

Nroba~
The ancient witch Nroba oversees the clan here.
~
Probably the only Drow you've ever seen to show true hints of old age, Nroba
tends to what remains of the ancient coven. Nroba appears malnourished and
unclean. She rests patiently as if waiting for something, although these old
tunnels doubtfully see any excitement. As you enter she glances at you with
little interest, then returns to her reclusive meditation.

Through the Hidden Tunnels...~
Several empty tunnels are revealed behind recently collapsed earth. The walls
are filled with un-mined ore. A deep mist has settled among the fungus on the
floor, obscuring vision. When you reach a certain point, a dark figure emerges
from the shadows, eyes glowing through the darkness. Behind the figure rests
an ancient doorway which is inscribed with countless arcane symbols.

In the Misty Cavern~
Vision in this room is minimal. You manage to discern a large sarcophagus on
the eastern wall. A long tunnel extends to the west. The smell of rotting
flesh is thick about this room; it seems there is no sign of life anywhere.
The ground is, oddly enough, soft and spongy.

In the Lich's Lair~
The sarcophagus leads to a secret tunnel, and then to a large open cavern. No
fungus grows here and the ground is hard. In the back rests a skeletal figure,
robed and adorned. Thick shadows conceal the north wall. You realize this to
be a lich, a feared and ancient undead mage. He stands idle against the wall,
giving no recognition of your intrusion.

A Narrow Tunnel~
Upon closer inspection of the northern wall in the liches lair, you
discovered a narrow tunnel leading into the blackness. For some reason you
decided to see where it led. To your dismay, you discover that the fungi and
insects have returned now to discomfort you as you squeeze through this
unknown tunnel.

The anatomist administers to the wounded in this small cavern. Cots and large
blankets substitute as beds for those resting under the aid of the anatomist.
The rodents, insects, fungus, and other minor inconveniences are held at bay
by magical warding.

A narrow hallway that was hidden among the pattern in the east wall of the
room leads to the west. A dim light illuminates the way westward. The walls
are stone, although run-down, and the ceiling is low. The ground is soft and
spongy.

End of the Hallway~
The musty hallway ends here, with only a door to the west. The north end of
the hallway seems to have been sealed off by a cave-in. No light escapes from
the cracks of the crude wooden door to the east. The stones that make up the
western wall seem to shift slightly as you progress down the hallway.

The Musty Corridor~
This corridor is musty and unused. The structure has deteriorated and doesn't
look very sturdy. There are doors leading into unknown chambers to the east
and the west. The corridor stretches north into the darkness, and south
towards Nroba, the ancient witch and caretaker of the coven.

The Coven House~
A furnished stone structure built into the mysterious caverns houses the
ancient Coven of Bone. It is run-down and appears as if it could collapse at
any moment. Most other hallways and corridors that branch off from this main
room have collapsed, blocking the exit, excluding only one, which leads
directly north. The ancient witch, Nroba, makes her home in this solitary
room. The majority of her time is spent in contemplation or meditation. Rags
upon the floor serve as a bed and the rodents and fungus growing about are a
source of food.

The Library~
This is a very large room, with rows upon rows of tattered and aged tomes and
scrolls. The topics of the books range from 'History of Solace' to spell
scrolls labeled 'Spiritwrack'. You eventually become lost among the towering
shelves and vast knowledge held within a single room.  A crude wooden door
to the east leads back into the hallway.

This small chamber consists of nothing other than arcane symbols carved
and etched onto the floor. The small individual symbols together form a
pentagram when viewed from overhead. This chamber is obviously used for
summoning - more specifically, summoning the denizens of the Lower Planes.

the endless clutter. Anything and everything that coven members don't want on
themselves is kept in this small room.
