giant starfish~
a giant starfish~
<94>A giant starfish floats through the water, hunting for gastropods and limpets.<0>
~
The giant starfish has a dense body with tan-coloured, thick arms. Its arms
contain blunt spines that are bluish in color with purple tips that are swollen
and surrounded by brown fuzz and pedicellariae that have a plier-like shape.
You'd guess it'd be 5 feet in diameter. It's minding its own business searching
for large gastropods and limpets it can use its flexible stomach to pry open
and absorb.

~
The pilot whale is mostly dark grey, with lighter grey patches behind his
dorsal fin, under his chin, behind his eye, and on his belly.  His dorsal
fin is set forward on the back and sweeps backwards. Larger and more
robust than most dolphins, pilot whales have a distinctive large, bulbous
melon. This guy is deep-diving to try and find some squid, one of his
favourite snacks.

The caudal fin of the ocean sunfish is replaced by a rounded clavus, creating
the ocean sunfish's distinct truncated shape. Its body is flattened laterally,
giving it a long oval shape when seen head-on. The pectoral fins are small and
fan-shaped, while the dorsal fin and the anal fin are lengthened, often making
the fish as tall as it is long.  This one looks to be nearly 3 metres tall.

giant gar alligator~
a giant gar~
<65>A massive, sleek alligator gar torpedoes through the deep.<0>
~
The body of this alligator gar is torpedo-shaped and olive in colour (fading
to a lighter gray on the ventral surface). Her scales are ganoid, which are 
bone-like, rhomboidal-shaped scales with serrated edges, which are covered 
by an enamel-like substance making them nearly impenetrable and excellent
protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of an
alligator gar like this has a dual row of large, sharp teeth that are used 
to impale and hold prey. This is a stalking, ambush predator, primarily
a piscivore, but they also prepared to ambush and eat waterfowl and small 
mammals found floating on the water's surface.

This 22-foot monster crustacean has a long body with a muscular tail and a
pair of huge, frightening-looking claws.  It seems particularly confident for
a lobster, and you surmise it is a male who has been frequently successful in
combat with other lobsters, and has thus risen to the top of the lobster
dominance heierarchy on the back of the bucketfuls of serotonin flowing through
its (relatively) tiny brain.

It doesn't seem interested in your presence, though, and will probably leave

<20>A huge, eel-like creature slithers through the abyssal depths.<0>
~
It resembles a bizarre eel, with a long, tubular body, a tail at one end, two
fins near the head, and another along the back. Its mouth is lamprey-like, and
filled with serrated, jawless teeth. You feel afraid just being in its presence,
and have a strong intuition that it might be best to leave it alone.

a strong protective exoskeleton, a fan-like tail, and a mass of poisonous

laghathti~
a laghathti~
<21>A spherical mass of writhing tentacles radiates pure evil.<0>
~
This is a laghathti,a kind of cephalopodan obyrith demon.  It has a loose 
resemblance to octopuses, but that comparison in no way captures its alien 
appearance. For one, it seemingly has no core; what passes for a body is 
really just a spherical mass of writhing tendrils, roughly 8 feet in diameter. 
Aside from that, its form consists of twelve, midnight-blue tentacles. Five 
of them have a pale underside riddled with hundreds of tiny mouths, another 
five are slimmer and ended in wide, paddle-like fins, and the other two are 
shorter, stronger, and end in long, crocodilian jaws from which the creature's 
high-pitched wails emanate.

The reekmurk is a huge, rare aquatic ooze, found usually in deep oceans.  It

wants to.

spiny flippers rather than legs. Its head resembles that of a sea anemone with 
a bulging red eye at the center and five long tentacles extending from behind 
the eye in a radial pattern around it. On both sides of its head are gigantic 
arms like those of a lobster ending in tremendous, barbed claws.

Arlauthra the black dragon has been a bane upon the domain for decades now, 
and now you stand before him, ready to mete out justice at long last.  He 
appears abnormally slender in comparison to other chromatic dragons--wiry, 
but not gaunt. His wicked horns protrude from the sides of his head and wrap 
around, projecting forward. A large frill adorns the upper part of its neck. 
He smells like nothing so much as rotting vegetation and foul water. He must 
be 5 metres tall and 25 metres long. He is not at all pleased to see you here.

A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals. 
This reef was formed by colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium 
carbonate. Like most coral reefs, this one was built from stony corals, whose 
polyps cluster in groups.  It really is beautiful.

Arena Way Westbridge, Lower~
<14>You stand on the bridge that connects Ota'ar Dar's arena canton to its military 
<87>canton. The arena canton gates lie to the south, while the imposing military 
<123>canton gates loom northward. To the east and west you may venture into the 
<159>deep canal system which separates Ota'ar Dar's cantons from each other, or you 
can head upwards, towards the huge, looming area of darkness in the water above.<0>

<252>Omu Canal, Upper<0>~
<237>You float about 4 metres above the ocean floor, in a deep canal between the two 
<238>major cantons of the Grung city of Omu. The high canal walls prevent access to 
<241>Omu from here, but you may travel north or east, further along the canal system,
<244>downwards, towards the ocean floor, or upwards, directly into the huge, looming
<246>area of darkness in the water above.<0>

you can swim north, into Ota'ar Dar's canal network.<0>
