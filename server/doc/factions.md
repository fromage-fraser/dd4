# Factions

_Factions_ are randomly generated allegiances of mobiles with their own personalities, abilities and buffs.

When the feature is enabled, the server will generate a random set of factions during start up.
Each faction has a unique name and set of characteristics and behaviours.
When mobiles are reset, there is a chance they will be made a member of a faction.

Factions add some random behaviour to otherwise quite static mobile definitions.
Factions can remember things about players, which can change their attitude to them.
Faction details are not persisted across server restarts.


## Turning on and off

The faction feature cannot be dynamically enabled on the running server.

To enable or disable at startup, change the initial value of `_feature_enabled` in _faction.c_.


## Commands

The wiz command `factions` displays faction details generated by the server.
